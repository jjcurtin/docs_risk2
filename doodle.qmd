# Doodle Bookable Calendars {#sec-doodle}

We will be using a Doodle Bookable Calendar to schedule consent/onboarding participants who meet the eligibility criteria. At the end of a successful screening survey, participants are randomly directed to one of these two calendars. 

## Primary calendar

The primary calendar itself is a gmail calendar owned by [star@psych.wisc.edu](mailto:star@psych.wisc.edu) 

## Secondary calendar

The secondary calendar is a gmail calendar owned by [arc@psych.wisc.edu](mailto:arc@psych.wisc.edu). This exists to allow double bookings on days when multiple RAs/Staff are scheduled
