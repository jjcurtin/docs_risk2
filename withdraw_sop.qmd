# Withdrawal/Discontinuation SOP

This SOP describes the steps study staff will take and the documentation required when a study participant withdraws consent, the principal investigator (PI) removes a participant from the study, or when the participant is lost to follow-up.

## Procedures

-	Tracking of participant removal, withdrawal, or lost to follow-up status is documented in the date_log_risk2, indicating the date the event occurred. 

-	In STAR - study staff must:

	-	Give the participant a *Study End Date*
	
	-	Turn off the *Has Private Messages Access* permission
	
	-	Turn off the *Has Discussion Group Access* permission (Only if participant was withdrawn for guideline violations)

## Withdrawal - Participants removed by the PI

-	The PI may remove a research participant from the study at any time in the event the participant*s safety or the safety of staff may be compromised. The message sent to the participant will depend on the reason(s) for withdrawal.  The circumstances may involve:

	-	Low Compliance
	
	-	Violation of Study Guidelines 
	
-	Documentation, including the date of removal and rationale, must be entered in the Date Log. 

## Discontinue - Participant decides to end their participation

-	Study staff should request the participant provide a written communication to the PI indicating their decision to stop participation. 

	-	This information should be logged in date_log_risk2
	
-	The date of this communication will serve as the date of participant withdrawal unless the participant has already done so verbally.

-	If the participant indicates their withdrawal verbally and is unwilling to do so in writing, date_log_risk2 should reflect these circumstances. 

-	At the time of participant withdrawal, the research team should inquire about the participant*s reason for withdrawal. 

## Participants lost to follow-up/non-responsive 

-	Five (5) contact attempts (through direct message/through email/through telephone) should be documented by study staff before considering the participant lost to follow-up: 

	-	At least one Direct Message
	
	-	At least one email 
	
	-	At least two text messages

	-	At least two phone calls
	
-	If study staff is unable to get a response, participant should be sent the Low Compliance withdrawal message
