## Prepare weekly mailings to newly added participants

1. Count the new participants and pull 1 pre-made Priority Mailer envelope per person

2. Enter payment card numbers into the Participant Payment Log:
    -   This PC \> Private drive \> studydata \> risk2 \> administration \> financial \> participant_payment_logs \> participant_payment_log_risk3.csv\
    -   If not already added, add subID and date, and your initials
    - Add "card registration/consent payment" to the notes field
    - Upload Notes is NA or blank
    -   Add cardholder ID
        -   Find the ID number on the Focus Blue envelope\
        -   Last 10 digits of the number on the front of the envelope (starts with 404)
        -   Save and close the payment log
   -   As you are entering the card numbers, on each Focus Blue envelope & Priority Mail Envelope, lightly write the participant's initials/subid in the corner so you can be sure there is no mis-match when they are mailed out.

3. Tell Susan to run the script to register the cards

4.  Prepare the welcome letters
    -   Open the first payment letter - in P:\\studydata\\risk2\\administration\\financial, named "first_payment_2021_04_21.docx"\
    -   You'll see a message "opening this document will run the following SQL Command". Hit No and the document will continue to open.
    -   Click the Mailings Menu tab.
    -   Click Select Recipients -\> use an existing list
    -   Browse to the funds file upload .csv that Susan prepared via script: P:\\studydata\\risk2\\administration\\financial\\participant_payment_logs\\funds_file_uploads
    -   Click Finish & Merge -\> Edit individual documents then hit "all".
    -   You'll usually get a note about an Empty Record, that's normal.
    -   Verify the addresses and names printed correctly for each letter, then print the letters to the First Floor Printer.

5.  Prepare the mailers 
    -   Verify the contents. Each mailer should contain
        -   Welcome letter (added at the time of mailing - everything else should have been pre-made according to the procedure above)
    -   Stamped small envelope
    - Highlighted W-9 form
    -   2 recruitment flyers\
    -   Focus Blue card envelope
    -   2-page disclosure
    - Add the newly printed Welcome letter, making sure the name matches the subid on the focus blue envelope and priority mail envelope

6. After Susan says the upload file is read, print postage labels. 
    - Open the upload file at P:\\studydata\\risk2\\administration\\financial\\participant_payment_logs\\funds_file_uploads.
    -   Login to USPS.com  Click'n'Ship at <https://www.usps.com/> : sewanta, password in LastPass
        -   Hit Click'n'Ship
        -   Scroll down to Step 2, Delivery Address (everything above that is pre-populated and needs no edits).
        -   Click Batch Order.
        -   Add the address from the focus blue upload file.
        -   Beneath the address click "Save to my address book" and then "Add to Batch".
        -   Repeat until all labels are entered. Scroll down and click the button "Select service and packaging". A new section will appear - you don't need to make ANY changes. At the bottom click "Add to Cart"
        -   On the next page you can review the order and make changes if needed (like if you double entered someone you'll see that here). If no changes, click Billing Information
        -   On the next page you have to click the box "I hereby authorize the USPS to charge....". Then click the Credit & Debit tab. The lab p-card visa is already pre-populated, you just need to enter 501 for the CVC. Then click Print & Pay\
    -   To print the labels, you have to scroll down and select all the labels using the check boxes, then scroll back up and print. Then print the labels to the first floor printer, 2 per page (no receipt needed).
    -   Cut them out around the dark border line\
    -   Tape them to the Priority Mail envelope in the indicated location - be sure NOT to let any tape cover any part of the large barcode, and the tape MUST go around all of the envelope (no loose edges)
    -   Verify the label name & address against the subid/name on the letter and focus blue card before sealing the Priority Envelope.

## Lost or Returned Card Procedure {#sec-lost-card}

1.  Payment card never made it to the participant, or we got the envelope returned in the mail:
    - Go through the steps listed above to send the participant a new packet
    - Do not create a new row in the Participant payment log. Instead, find the original row and move the OLD card number to the "upload notes" column, along with the date of replacement.
    - Put the new card number in the cardholder ID column
    - Tag Susan in the subid thread that the card is ready to be replaced
2.  Card was lost/stolen/destroyed after activation
    -   Do not send replacement card
    -   In Google Voice, text the participant the US Bank Card Services number (877-474-0010) and let them know they should contact US Bank directly for a replacement
