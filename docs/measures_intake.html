<p>Global Instructions</p>
<p>This is the first monthly update. It consists of different surveys that ask about aspects of your life and your recovery including your age, income, household, history of opioid and other drug use, drug treatment services, life events, and emotions. This first monthly update is longer than other monthly updates because it asks questions about your background. Completing this survey will take about 30 minutes and you will receive a $10 payment for completing it. Please read through all questions carefully and answer them honestly. All of your responses will be kept completely private. <page break=""> The term “opioid” in these surveys refers to prescription opioids (like Oxycontin or Vicodin), synthetic opioids (fentanyl), and heroin. Below is a list of commonly used terms for these substances: Oxycodone (Oxycontin, Percocet, oxy, percs, O.C., rims, tires, greenies) Hydrocodone (Vicodin, Lortab, Norco, vike, bananas, fluff, hydros) Morphine (Kadian, Duramorph, MS Contin, miss Emma, monkey, white stuff, M) Codeine (lean, captain Cody, little C, schoolboy) Buprenorphine (Suboxone, Subutex, buse, sobos, strips, oranges) Hydromorphone (Dilaudid, Exalgo, smack, dillies, footballs, juice) Methadone (Methadose, Dolophine, tootsie roll, red rock, mud, dolls) Oxymorphone (Opana, biscuits, mrs. O, O bomb, octagon) Tramadol (Ultram, chill pills, trammies, ultras) Fentanyl (Sublimaze, Actiq, apache, goodfella, TNT) Heroin (black tar, black pearl, black, china white, dope, white lady, smack, snow, speedball) <page break=""> When we ask about your use of opioids or other drugs, we often use the term “non-medical reasons” When you see this term, please think about your use of drugs to feel intoxicated or high. This includes taking more of a drug than you were prescribed, taking it more frequently than prescribed, or using a drug for reasons other than it was prescribed for.</page></page></p>
