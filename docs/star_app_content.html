<p><strong>High Risk Locations</strong> - Users can add “High Risk Locations” for places that they think may be harmful to their recovery. Adding a high-risk location sets up an alert from Star that will go off when they are at the location.</p>
<p><strong>Lock Screen Settings</strong> - Users can set, change, or delete a lock screen pin for STAR. If you add create a PIN, you will need to type in that PIN when you open STAR after it has been closed for several minutes.</p>
<p>To set a pin tap “Lock Screen Settings” and then “Setup”. To change an existing PIN, tap “Reset your PIN”. Using the number pad, tap out a four-digit number, then tap “Enter”. Follow the instructions to confirm your new PIN by retyping the same four-digit number and tapping “Enter”.</p>
<p>Information from CHESS:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It is not possible to recover a pin if they are using the pin lock. However, you can log out from that screen where you enter the pin and log back in to reset the pin. Also, if you log out and log back in, the pin should be reset.</p></li>
<li><p>People’s PIN is not something we can ever see and it’s not saved on the STAR server, just locally.</p></li>
<li><p>If a user moves the app to the background, such as if they open a new app, and doesn’t return to the app within 10 minutes then they will be required to enter their pin again. If they completely close the app i.e.&nbsp;swipe the app away, they will need to enter their pin again.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notification Settings</strong> - Users can control push notifications from STAR. Turn different notifications on or off by tapping the check box next to the notification. To receive all notifications, you should check all the boxes. To receive no notifications, you should uncheck all the boxes. Turning off your Notification settings will not affect your participation; however, you may find that having them turned on is helpful for remembering to complete the tasks. When you are done customizing your notification settings, tap the “Save” button</p>
<p><strong>Research Study Settings</strong> Users change their data sharing permissions by tapping the “Research Study Settings” button.</p>
<p>If you tap “Change Settings” you will see a message warning you that turning off GPS and Phone/SMS data sharing will reduce your next bonus by up to $15 and asking you if would like to continue.</p>
<p>If you tap “Yes” you will be directed to your phone’s settings where you can change the STAR permissions.</p>
<p><strong>Admin Setting</strong> Admin accounts can choose whether to make their account visible to client users by changing their Admin Settings.</p>

<p><strong>Ted talks</strong></p>
<p><em>“Addiction is a disease. We should treat it as one.”</em>- Only one in nine people in the United States gets the care and treatment they need for drug abuse. A former Director of National Drug Control Policy, Michael Botticelli is working to end this epidemic and treat people with addictions with kindness, compassion and fairness. In a personal, thoughtful talk, he encourages the millions of Americans in recovery today to make their voices heard and confront the stigma associated with drug abuse.</p>
<p><em>“Disconnected brains: How isolation fuels opioid addiction”</em>- Opioids abuse is now officially a national emergency. But why are drug use rates spiking and what can we do about it? Neuroscientist Rachel Wurzman shares new research about how the brain reacts to opioids, replacing the sense of community and belonging human beings are losing. We are beginning to understand that solving the opioid epidemic will require us to focus on social factors surrounding those affected. Dr.&nbsp;Rachel Wurzman is a Fellow with the Center for Neuroscience and Society, and a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Neurology with the Laboratory for Cognition and Neural Stimulation at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p><em>“Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong.”</em> - What really causes addiction — to everything from cocaine to smart-phones? And how can we overcome it? Johann Hari has seen our current methods fail firsthand, as he has watched loved ones struggle to manage their drug use. As he shares in this deeply personal talk, his questions took him around the world, and unearthed some surprising and hopeful ways of thinking about an age-old problem.</p>
<p><em>“From genes to addiction: How risk unfolds across the lifespan”</em> - What does it mean when something like drug use or depression is genetically influenced? Are people who are at risk destined to develop problems? Psychologist Danielle Dick explores how our genes and our environments come together across the lifespan to create multiple pathways that can influence addiction.</p>
<p><em>“How genetics and enviroment wok together to shape our destiny”</em> -A young scientist in Bulgaria with lots of prestigious awards for best scientific excellence practices I put my all energy in revealing the secrets of the way our DNA functions.<br>
The way we live, the way we talk, the way we breathe and the environment is what shapes our destinies and is controlling our genomes…..and as I breathe in and out with science, it might be interesting to follow my endeavours on the battlefield of Molecular Biology.</p>
<p><em>“How isolation fuels opioid addiction”</em> - What do Tourette syndrome, heroin addiction and social media obsession all have in common? They converge in an area of the brain called the striatum, says neuroscientist Rachel Wurzman — and this critical discovery could reshape our understanding of the opioid crisis. Sharing insights from her research, Wurzman shows how social isolation contributes to opioid use and overdose rates and reveals how meaningful human connection could offer a potentially powerful source of recovery.</p>
<p><em>“Listening to shame”</em> -Shame is an unspoken epidemic, the secret behind many forms of broken behavior. Brené Brown, whose earlier talk on vulnerability became a viral hit, explores what can happen when people confront their shame head-on. Her own humor, humanity and vulnerability shine through every word.</p>
<p><em>“Six steps to life -altering change”</em> -Maurice (Moe) Egan grew up in East Oakland surrounded by drugs and crime. Even though he found success in sports and later working for Coretta Scott King at the Martin Luther King Jr.&nbsp;Center, his drug use and criminal behavior spiraled out of control. He found himself homeless and asleep standing up in the middle of a busy San Francisco intersection soon to be arrested for the seventh time. Moe and Tim Stay share six steps for transformational behavioral change that have helped Moe and the tens of thousands of others like him change their lives. Together, Moe and Tim share the philosophy taught at The Other Side Academy to help others who are lost obtain lives of sobriety, integrity, and fulfillment.</p>
<p><em>“The harm reduction model of drug addiction treatment”</em> “What causes opioid addiction, and why it is so tough to combat?”-In the 1980s and 90s, pharmaceutical companies began to market opioid painkillers aggressively, while actively downplaying their addictive potential. The number of prescriptions skyrocketed, and so did cases of addiction, beginning a crisis that continues today. Mike Davis explains what we can do to reverse the skyrocketing rates of drug use and overdose. [Directed by Good Bad Habits, narrated by Addison Anderson, music by Landon Trimble/ Playdate].</p>
<p><em>“Why we need to end the wat on drugs.”</em> -Is the War on Drugs doing more harm than good? In a bold talk, drug policy reformist Ethan Nadelmann makes an impassioned plea to end the “backward, heartless, disastrous” movement to stamp out the drug trade. He gives two big reasons we should focus on intelligent regulation instead</p>

<p><strong>Learn about recovery</strong></p>
<p><em>“Can addiction be treated sucessfully”</em> - Yes. Addiction is a treatable, chronic disorder that can be managed successfully.<br>
Research shows that combining behavioral therapy with medications, if available, is the best way to ensure success for most patients.<br>
The combination of medications and behavioral interventions to treat a substance use disorder is known as medication-assisted treatment. Treatment approaches must be tailored to address each patient’s drug use patterns and drug-related medical, psychiatric, environmental, and social problems.</p>
<p><em>“Does drug and alcohol abuse cause mental disorders, or vice versa”</em> - Drug and alcohol abuse and mental disorders often occur at the same time. This is referred to as co-existing conditions or comorbidities. Over half of the people with a drug and alcohol abuse also have another mental health issue. This doesn’t necessarily mean that one caused the other.<br>
There are three ways to look at this; In some cases mental illness can lead to addiction. In other cases, drug and alcohol abuse can cause a mental illness or lastly both drug abuse and a mental disorder are both caused by a common risk factor.</p>
<p><em>“Does it really matter how we talk about addiction?”</em> -The old adage, “Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me,” implies words cannot convey harm. Today, however, more and more research on stigma is showing that words truly can hurt people, and in ways that the users of those words may not anticipate. This seems to be especially true when those words serve to reinforce misconceptions and misrepresentations of already heavily stigmatized medical conditions.</p>
<p><em>“From pills to fentanyl: Three personal stories that show how the opioid crisis evolved”</em>- Three drugs are responsible for creating the deadly U.S. opioid epidemic: prescription pain pills, heroin and fentanyl. As of 2018, the crisis had claimed more than 400,000 lives.<br>
Yet the faces of some victims remain hidden. Grieving families embarrassed by the stigma of drug abuse write “passed peacefully at home” in obituaries.The Washington Post spoke with families and friends of more than 70 victims that span the epidemic. Here are some of their stories, remembered through the lens of their families.</p>
<p><em>“Recovery research institute: Resources”</em> - The Recovery Research Institute is a leading nonprofit research institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, an affiliate of Harvard Medical School, dedicated to the advancement of drug use treatment and recovery.</p>

In other words, Soberocity is a place where individuals who are invigorated about all the opportunities that come from living a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p><em>“Stages of addiction and recovery”</em> - While more research is needed, recovery models remain an effective means for understanding change behavior and the process of moving from active drug use into long-term recovery.<br>
This article from recoveryanswers.org discusses 3 models:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Transtheoretical Stages of Change Model</p></li>
<li><p>The Life Course Perspective</p></li>
<li><p>The Hierarchy of Needs Perspective</p></li>

<p><em>“Unraveling: How women are surviving the opioid crisis.”</em> - Each day, more than 130 lives will be lost to an opioid overdose. A year after the crisis was declared a public health emergency, it was reported that Americans are more likely to die from an opioid overdose than from a car crash. Women, who are most often the center of our care networks, have been affected in profound and myriad ways. They’ve buried children or taken in those of family members unfit to care for them. They’ve been overprescribed for pain management and underserved when the addiction set in. Over the course of the next eight weeks, we’ll be sharing their stories.</p>
<p><em>“What is the impact of addiction”</em> - Issues related to drug use are among the top public health problems in the U.S. and other nations around the world.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Drug use can have an impact on health for the user, their social network, their community, society, and the economy.</p></li>
<li><p>According to studies involving clinical experts and scientists (Nutt et al., 2010), alcohol is considered to be the most harmful drug due its indirect effects involving other people, followed by heroin and cocaine. Alcohol is also considered to be the third most harmful in terms of effects directly impacting the user, after heroin and cocaine.</p></li>
<li><p>The impact of drug use may be reduced with early intervention (Dennis et al., 2004). Alcohol and other drug use is the principle contributor to disability-adjusted life years lost for young people (Mokdad et al., 2016).</p></li>
<li><p>Early intervention may help minimize substance use disorder in adulthood, as 90% of adults with substance use disorder first used before the age of 18, and 50% started before the age of 15.</p></li>

<p><strong>Book Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><em>“A Million Little Pieces”</em> By James Frey-A story of drug and alcohol use and rehabilitation as it has never been told before. Recounted in visceral, kinetic prose, and crafted with a forthrightness that rejects piety, cynicism, and self-pity, it brings us face-to-face with a provocative new understanding of the nature and the meaning of recovery.<br>
By the time he entered a drug and alcohol treatment facility, James Frey had taken his addictions to near-deadly extremes. He had so thoroughly ravaged his body that the facility’s doctors were shocked he was still alive. The ensuing torments of withdrawal, and the never-ending urge to use chemicals, are captured with a vitality and directness that recalls the seminal eye-opening power of William Burroughs’s Junky.<br>
But A Million Little Pieces refuses to fit any mold of drug literature. Inside the clinic, James is surrounded by patients as troubled as he is – including a judge, a mobster, a one-time world-champion boxer, and a fragile former prostitute to whom he is not allowed to speak ó but their friendship and advice strikes James as stronger and truer than the clinic’s droning dogma of How to Recover. James refuses to consider himself a victim of anything but his own bad decisions, and insists on accepting sole accountability for the person he has been and the person he may become–which runs directly counter to his counselors’ recipes for recovery.<br>
James has to fight to find his own way to confront the consequences of the life he has lived so far, and to determine what future, if any, he holds. It is this fight, told with the charismatic energy and power of One Flew over the Cuckoo’s Nest, that is at the heart of A Million Little Pieces: the fight between one young man’s will and the ever-tempting chemical trip to oblivion, the fight to survive on his own terms, for reasons close to his own heart.<br>
A Million Little Pieces is an uncommonly genuine account of a life destroyed and a life reconstructed. It is also the introduction of a bold and talented literary voice.</p>
<p><em>“Blackout: Remembering the Things I Drank to Forget”</em>- For Sarah Hepola, alcohol was “the gasoline of all adventure.” She spent her evenings at cocktail parties and dark bars where she proudly stayed till last call. Drinking felt like freedom, part of her birthright as a strong, enlightened twenty-first-century woman.<br>
But there was a price. She often blacked out, waking up with a blank space where four hours should be. Mornings became detective work on her own life. What did I say last night? How did I meet that guy? She apologized for things she couldn’t remember doing, as though she were cleaning up after an evil twin. Publicly, she covered her shame with self-deprecating jokes, and her career flourished, but as the blackouts accumulated, she could no longer avoid a sinking truth. The fuel she thought she needed was draining her spirit instead.<br>
A memoir of unblinking honesty and poignant, laugh-out-loud humor, Blackout is the story of a woman stumbling into a new kind of adventure – the sober life she never wanted. Shining a light into her blackouts, she discovers the person she buried, as well as the confidence, intimacy, and creativity she once believed came only from a bottle. Her tale will resonate with anyone who has been forced to reinvent or struggled in the face of necessary change. It’s about giving up the thing you cherish most – but getting yourself back in return.</p>
<p><em>“Delicious Foods- By James Hannaham”</em> -Held captive by her employers – and by her own demons – on a mysterious farm, a widow struggles to reunite with her young son in this uniquely American story of freedom, perseverance, and survival.<br>
Darlene, once an exemplary wife and a loving mother to her young son, Eddie, finds herself devastated by the unforeseen death of her husband. Unable to cope with her grief, she turns to drugs, and quickly forms an addiction. One day she disappears without a trace.<br>
Unbeknownst to eleven-year-old Eddie, now left behind in a panic-stricken search for her, Darlene has been lured away with false promises of a good job and a rosy life. A shady company named Delicious Foods shuttles her to a remote farm, where she is held captive, performing hard labor in the fields to pay off the supposed debt for her food, lodging, and the constant stream of drugs the farm provides to her and the other unfortunates imprisoned there.<br>
In Delicious Foods, James Hannaham tells the gripping story of three unforgettable characters: a mother, her son, and the drug that threatens to destroy them. Through Darlene’s haunted struggle to reunite with Eddie, through the efforts of both to triumph over those who would enslave them, and through the irreverent and mischievous voice of the drug that narrates Darlene’s travails, Hannaham’s daring and shape-shifting prose infuses this harrowing experience with grace and humor.<br>
The desperate circumstances that test the unshakeable bond between this mother and son unfold into myth, and Hannaham’s treatment of their ordeal spills over with compassion. Along the way we experience a tale at once contemporary and historical that wrestles with timeless questions of love and freedom, forgiveness and redemption, tenacity and the will to survive.</p>
<p><em>“Drinking a Love Story- by Caroline Knapp”</em> -Fifteen million Americans a year are plagued with alcoholism. Five million of them are women. Many of them, like Caroline Knapp, started in their early teens and began to use alcohol as “liquid armor,” a way to protect themselves against the difficult realities of life. In this extraordinarily candid and revealing memoir, Knapp offers important insights not only about alcoholism, but about life itself and how we learn to cope with it.<br>
It was love at first sight. The beads of moisture on a chilled bottle. The way the glasses clinked and the conversation flowed. Then it became obsession. The way she hid her bottles behind her lover’s refrigerator. The way she slipped from the dinner table to the bathroom, from work to the bar. And then, like so many love stories, it fell apart. Drinking is Caroline Kapp’s harrowing chronicle of her twenty-year love affair with alcohol.<br>
Caroline had her first drink at fourteen. She drank through her years at an Ivy League college, and through an award-winning career as an editor and columnist. Publicly she was a dutiful daughter, a sophisticated professional. Privately she was drinking herself into oblivion. This startlingly honest memoir lays bare the secrecy, family myths, and destructive relationships that go hand in hand with drinking. And it is, above all, a love story for our times—full of passion and heartbreak, betrayal and desire—a triumph over the pain and deception that mark an alcoholic life.</p>
<p><em>“Graceland- by Chris Abani”</em> -The sprawling, swampy, cacophonous city of Lagos, Nigeria, provides the backdrop to the story of Elvis, a teenage Elvis impersonator hoping to make his way out of the ghetto. Broke, beset by floods, and beatings by his alcoholic father, and with no job opportunities in sight, Elvis is tempted by a life of crime. Thus begins his odyssey into the dangerous underworld of Lagos, guided by his friend Redemption and accompanied by a restless hybrid of voices including The King of Beggars, Sunday, Innocent and Comfort. Ultimately, young Elvis, drenched in reggae and jazz, and besotted with American film heroes and images, must find his way to a GraceLand of his own.<br>
Nuanced, lyrical, and pitch perfect, Abani has created a remarkable story of a son and his father, and an examination of postcolonial Nigeria where the trappings of American culture reign supreme.</p>
<p><em>“Gun, Needle, Spoon- By Patrick O’Neil”</em> - This memoir follows a punk rock pioneer on his slide into drug abuse and life as an armed robber, all the way through life in recovery and what it’s like to look back on those times, knowing all the while that he is still under the threat of three strikes, a twenty-five-to-life prison sentence waiting. He has no choice but to deal with it all drug free.</p>
<p><em>“Guts- By Kristen Johnston”</em>- A harrowing and hysterical memoir by the two-time Emmy Award-winning actress from the hit television show 3rd Rock from the Sun.<br>
“It felt like I was speeding on the Autobahn toward hell, trapped inside a DeLorean with no brakes. And even if I could somehow stop, I’d still be screwed, because there’s no way I’d ever be able to figure out how to open those insane, cocaine-designed doors.”</p>
<p><em>“High on Arrival- By Makenzie Phillips”</em>- Not long before her fiftieth birthday, Mackenzie Phillips walked into Los Angeles International Airport. She was on her way to a reunion for One Day at a Time, the hugely popular 70s sitcom on which she once starred as the lovable rebel Julie Cooper. Within minutes of entering the security checkpoint, Mackenzie was in handcuffs, arrested for possession of cocaine and heroin.<br>
Born into rock and roll royalty, flying in Lear jets to the Virgin Islands at five, making pot brownies with her father’s friends at eleven, Mackenzie grew up in an all-access kingdom of hippie freedom and heroin cool. It was a kingdom over which her father, the legendary John Phillips of The Mamas &amp; the Papas, presided, often in absentia, as a spellbinding, visionary phantom.<br>
When Mackenzie was a teenager, Hollywood and the world took notice of the charming, talented, precocious child actor after her star-making turn in American Graffiti. As a young woman she joined the nonstop party in the hedonistic pleasure dome her father created for himself and his fellow revelers, and a rapt TV audience watched as Julie Cooper wasted away before their eyes. By the time Mackenzie discovered how deep and dark her father’s trip was going, it was too late. And as an adult, she has paid dearly for a lifetime of excess, working tirelessly to reconcile a wonderful, terrible past in which she succumbed to the power of drug use and the pull of her magnetic father.<br>
As her astounding, outrageous, and often tender life story unfolds, the actor-musician-mother shares her lifelong battle with personal demons. She overcomes seemingly impossible obstacles again and again and journeys toward redemption and peace. By exposing the shadows and secrets of the past to the light of day, the star who turned up High on Arrival has finally come back down to earth – to stay.<br>

<p><em>“How to grow up- By Michelle Tea”</em>-As an aspiring young writer in San Francisco, Michelle Tea lived in a scuzzy communal house: she drank; she smoked; she snorted anything she got her hands on; she toiled for the minimum wage; she dated men and women, and sometimes both at once. But between hangovers and dead-end jobs, she scrawled in notebooks and organized dive bar poetry readings, working to make her literary dreams a reality.<br>
In How to Grow Up, Tea shares her awkward stumble towards the life of a Bona Fide Grown-Up: healthy, responsible, self-aware, and stable. She writes about passion, about her fraught relationship with money, about adoring Barney’s while shopping at thrift stores, about breakups and the fertile ground between relationships, about roommates and rent, and about being superstitious (“why not, it imbues this harsh world of ours with a bit of magic”). At once heartwarming and darkly comic, How to Grow Up proves that the road less traveled may be a difficult one, but if you embrace life’s uncertainty and dust yourself off after every screw up, slowly but surely, you just might make it to adulthood.</p>
<p><em>“In Pain: A Bioethicist’s Personal Strugfle with Opioids- By Travis N Rieder”</em> - A bioethicist’s harrowing memoir of opioid dependence and withdrawal–and a clarion call to challenge the status quo of healthcare and of medicine itself–[this book] reveals the lack of crucial resources and structures to responsibly manage pain in America. Travis Rieder’s terrifying journey down the rabbit hole of opioid dependence began with a motorcycle accident in 2015. One month and several surgeries later, Travis was on painkillers around the clock. The drugs he received were both miraculous and essential to his recovery–for a time. But the most profound suffering Travis would endure arrived months after the accident, when he went into acute opioid withdrawal while following his physician’s orders. Over the course of four excruciating weeks, Rieder experienced firsthand, all day long and through the night, what it means to be ‘dope sick’–the absolute physical and mental agony that is opioid withdrawal. Clueless how to taper off these intensely powerful painkillers, Travis turned to his doctors, who suggested that he go back on the drugs and simply try again later. Rieder’s experience exposes a dark secret of American healthcare: the crisis currently facing us is actually an unsurprising and inevitable consequence of a culture deeply conflicted about opioids and a system grossly inept at managing them. As he recounts his own brutal story of pain and pills, Rieder provides the fascinating history and trajectory of these drugs, from their invention in the 1800s through a long period of opiophobia to the eventual warm embrace of these medications that led to an environment of aggressive, even reckless, prescribing. Here rigorous examinations of the science of pain and addiction are considered alongside analyses of the systemic and cultural barriers we must overcome if we are to address the problem effectively on both a local and a global scale.<br>
<br>
[This book] is not only a gripping personal account of drug dependence, but also a groundbreaking exploration of the complex causes of our opioid epidemic and a path to resolving the crisis through provider education, policy, and alternative treatment advocacy. Rieder makes very clear that the opioid crisis exists against a backdrop of real, debilitating pain that providers cannot ignore but can learn to treat more effectively and safely. Pain management is profoundly broken in America, and the result is devastating for both patients and those at risk for addiction. But we do not, Rieder argues, have to accept this situation. By changing medical practice, adopting reasonable drug policies, and altering the way we view those who take drugs (both prescription and not), we can reduce suffering and save lives; we can give people the care they deserve.</p>
<p>“Permanent Midnight- By Jerry Stahl”- Jerry Stahl’s seminal memoir of drug addiction and a career in Hollywood, Permanent Midnight is a classic along the lines of Hubert Selby, Jr.’s Last Exit to Brooklyn. Illuminating the self-loathing and self-destruction of an addict’s inner life, Permanent Midnight follows Stahl through the dregs of addiction and into recovery. In 1998, Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, and Maria Bello starred in a film version of Permanent Midnight to much acclaim. Nic Sheff, author of Tweak, writes the introduction to this edition.</p>
<p><em>“Terry: My Daughter’s Life- and- Death Struggle with Alcoholism- By George McGovern”</em> -Just before Christmas 1994 Terry McGovern was found frozen to death in a snowbank in Madison, Wisconsin, where she had stumbled out of a bar and fallen asleep in the cold. Just forty-five years old, she had been an alcoholic most of her life. Now, in this harrowing and intimate reminiscence, her father, former Senator George McGovern, examines her diaries, interviews her friends and doctors, sifts through medical records, and searches for the lovely but fragile young woman who had waged a desperate, lifelong battle with her illness.<br>
<br>
What emerges is the portrait of a woman who was loved by everyone but herself. Surrounded by devoted parents, caring siblings, and two young daughters of her own, Terry maintained an appearance of control but was haunted by the twin demons of alcohol and depression. Her story is a heartbreaking tale of her attempts at sobriety, the McGovern family’s efforts to help her—and the failure of both. With courage and compassion, George McGovern addresses a private tragedy with an honesty rarely achieved by a public figure, looking candidly at his inability to save his child. A primer for other families who live with addiction, McGovern’s book is filled with wisdom and an understanding that can come only from sharing his tremendous loss with others.</p>
<p><em>“Unwifeable: A memoir- By Mandy Stadmiller”</em> - Provocative, fearless, and dizzyingly uncensored, Mandy spills every secret she knows about dating, networking, comedy, celebrity, media, psychology, relationships, addiction, and the quest to find one’s true nature. She takes readers behind the scenes (and name names) as she relays her utterly addictive journey.<br>
<br>
Starting in 2005, Mandy picks up everything to move across the country to Manhattan, looking for a fresh start. She is newly divorced, thirty-years-old, with a dream job at the New York Post. She is ready to conquer the city, the industry, the world. But underneath the glitz and glamour, there is a darker side threatening to surface. The drug-fueled, never-ending party starts off as thrilling…but grows ever-terrifying. Too many blackout nights and scary decisions begin to add up. As she searches for the truth behind the façade, Mandy realizes that falling in love won’t fix her—until she learns to accept herself first.</p>

<p><em>The purpose of the STAR Guidelines is to set expectations for Participant interactions with the discussion board and in communication with STAR Staff.</em></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>By joining STAR, you agree to abide by all rules and guidelines when communicating on STAR message boards, direct messages, and during phone calls with STAR staff. Our Guidelines are designed to ensure all participants and staff are protected and are treated professionally and with respect. All in-app messages, posts, and phone calls with staff are regularly reviewed by the STAR team, and staff will remove any discussion post, comment, or individual member who does not adhere to stated rules and guidelines.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Guideline 1: Always Use Respectful Language</strong> - It is important to us that the STAR app and procedures create a space where individuals feel comfortable, safe, and empowered to communicate while supporting their recovery. Therefore, STAR will not tolerate harassment, hate speech, violent or vulgar remarks, or exclusionary language of any kind on app discussion boards, direct messages, or via phone/email/direct message communications with STAR staff. This includes hurtful or targeted language against someone on the basis of their race, ethnicity, national origin, disability, financial class, religious affiliation, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, or any other individual characteristics. Whenever you are posting on message boards, sending direct messages, or talking on the phone with STAR Staff, remember that there’s a human being on the other end.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>What we expect from you:</strong> For the safety and comfort of all study staff and participants in the STAR study, we expect you to use respectful language in all communication. This includes not making any inappropriate, flirtatious, threatening, or rude comments to study staff or other study participants.<br>
In Direct Messages with study staff and in posts to the Discussion Board, do not use offensive, obscene, or sexually explicit language, jokes, or stories. Do not use derogatory names or labels (directly or implied) when referring to individuals or groups. Any use of this language will result in an immediate warning and possible subsequent removal from the STAR Study</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>What you can expect from us:</strong> Every member of the STAR team is committed to maintaining a high standard for communication with participants. We will always use polite and respectful language as outlined above when communicating with you. If you are ever concerned that a member of the STAR team is not meeting this standard, please to not hesitate to share that concern. Our team will review all language from staff and participants and remove content that does not meet this standard.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Guideline 2: Use a Professional Communication Style</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>All posts should be professional and courteous. Accepted internet standards for professional online communication include not using all-caps (or SHOUTING) in your posts, maintaining a civil tone, respecting the privacy of others, and staying on-topic.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>What we expect from you:</strong> Please communicate with staff and other STAR participants as you would in a professional work setting. You may send direct messages to staff with questions, comments, or concerns about the STAR study at any time. However, all Direct Messages to staff should be on topic and professional in tone. Similarly, posts and replies to topics on discussion boards should remain on topic and maintain a professional tone. To stay on topic, please do not overshare personal information or ask personal questions to STAR staff or other participants and limit your communication to STAR procedures or posted discussion topics. To maintain professional tone, we ask that you do not post or comment on discussion boards, direct message staff, or call/email STAR staff when you are feeling highly emotional or are under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Please wait to send all communication until you feel you are in a calm and comfortable state of mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>What you can expect from us:</strong> Our team is committed to responding to all messages from our participants in a prompt and professional manner. In addition to the standards outlined above, you can expect that any direct message or phone call received by STAR staff to be responded to within 1 - 2 business days of the message being received. If you are ever reaching out to report an issue with the STAR app, you will not be penalized for study tasks missed while waiting for a response from study staff.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Guideline 3: Safe Communication/Privacy</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Communications on the STAR app and with STAR staff are secure to protect your privacy. Since posts and comments on message boards are able to be viewed by other authorized STAR users, we request that all users follow general internet safety guidelines to prevent unintentional sharing of personal information to others. When writing on STAR discussion boards, avoid sharing personal or private information that you would not be willing to share with a total stranger. For example, you should never share your full name, your phone number, your address, or your social security number. If you would shred it, don’t share it. STAR staff will remove any posts where someone is attempting to gather personal or private information from other users on the platform.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>What we expect from you:</strong> Due to the personal nature of the STAR study, we ask that you avoid sharing personal identifying information about yourself or any other participants. In the course of your participation, you may discover that you know other people also participating in the study. While you are free to discuss details of your participation in the study with people on other platforms, please be mindful of the information you are sharing within the STAR app to make sure that you are not accidentally sharing personal information about someone else. The STAR team reserves the right to remove anything that that they deem to contain or attempt to gather personal identifying information. Any questions about what may be too sensitive to post to discussion boards should be directed to the STAR Help account via DM.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>What you expect from us:</strong> You should expect that we will always consider your safety to be our top priority. This includes having multiple protocols in place to protect your privacy, including storing your contact information in a locked location that is separate from your data, restricting access to your contact information, and labeling all of your data with an anonymous id number, (a full list of the privacy protections can be found in the Consent Form). Additionally, we will never post or share any information about you with any other STAR participants. Even if you know other participants in the STAR study, we will never share any information about participants with any other participants.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Review Process -</strong> We maintain a record of all messages and posts sent within the STAR app, as well as all phone and email conversations with STAR staff outside of the app. These records are regularly reviewed by our STAR team to ensure communication follows our stated guidelines. If a member of the STAR team detects language or behavior that does not follow our guidelines, a private written warning will be sent to individuals following their first offense. A second offense may result in the person’s account being removed from the app and withdrawal from the STAR study. Study staff will always be available to discuss decisions about warnings or withdrawal. These guidelines are meant to serve as general rules for the type of behavior that will result in a warning or possible withdrawal from the STAR study. This is not an exclusive list. The STAR team reserves the right to determine if a participant has behaved inappropriately.</p>

Staff and RAs will be responsible for routine moderation. Participants are instructed that inappropriate posts will be removed, and repeated violations may result in withdrawal. <strong>We do not plan on spending time populating the message boards.</strong></li>
