Participants fill out a screening survey; if eligible, they are directed to a Doodle poll to schedule an Onboarding/Consent call\nConsent and onboarding. Participants are walked though the study procedures and consent form. Once they give consent, they provide demographic information and are assigned a subID, and are walked through installing the app. They are instructed to watch a set of video tutorials to learn to use the STAR app. They are scheduled for a 1-week check in phone call. They are mailed a set of onboarding materials including a payment card.\nOne-week check-in. Enrolled participants meet with study staff after 1 week via video call to troubleshoot any technical issues and otherwise ensure that they have what they need to participate fully. Specifically ask if they have been recording their faces in the daily video check-ins / if that has been comfortable.\nMonthly payment. Every month participants will be issued a bonus in the form of a reload on a debit card. They will be sent a confirmation of this payment with a summary of the length of their participation, acknowledgement of their scheduled end date, a summary of their compliance over the month, and a statement of the bonus amount being issued.\nDebriefing. At the end of the study enrollment period, whether this is after one year or earlier (e.g., for participants to discontinue and who we are able to get in touch with) meet briefly with study staff for a debriefing session.\nDocumentation of participant issues & activities. Each participant has an admin thread in the proj-risk2-admin slack channel. Study activities and participant communication are recorded here. Additionally, There is a Web Log (WOG) where issues with participant data are recorded. There is also a Date Log where participant visit dates and changes in study status are documented."

    "title": "5  ARC STAR Website Frequently Asked Questions",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Q: Do I have to fill out my profile?\nA: No, filling out your profile is not required since it is not a study task. However, you may find that filling out your profile helps you feel more engaged and comfortable as you use the app.\nQ: Will the app use up my cellular data?\nA: The app may sometimes use cellular data. For example, if you are not on Wifi when you are doing your daily video check-in, uploading the video will use your cellular data. For this reason, you will see a warning when your wifi is off and you’ll be doing something that may use a lot of cellular data, like the daily video check in.\nQ: Will the app use up my battery?\nA: You should not see any increased battery drain, but if you notice any big changes to your phone’s battery life, please let us know.\nQ: Does the app take up a lot of space on my phone?\nA: This app takes approximately 150 MB storage space on your phone, which is about half the amount of space as the average game or social media app.\nQ: What do I do if the app gets deleted off my phone?\nA: If the Star app is removed from your phone, please contact UW study staff as soon as possible for a new download link.\nQ: Where can I find the information on minimum data sharing requirements?\nA: This information can be found on this web page, and also in your copy of the study consent form.\nQ: What happens if I move during the study?\nA: If your mailing address changes during the study, please contact the UW study staff as soon as possible. We will need to update your payment information including new mailing addresses and billing zip codes.\nQ: What if I get seriously sick or injured during the study?\nA: If you are unable to complete study tasks due to illness or injury, please contact our UW study staff as soon as possible so that we can discuss your options.\nQ: Can I pause my participation?\nA: Yes, if you contact UW study staff we can pause your participation.\nQ: How do I get in contact with the UW study staff?\nA: For non-urgent matters, send UW study staff a direct message through the app; call us at (608) 890-7494; or email star@psych.wisc.edu. If you need to talk to someone immediately, please contact your regular treatment provider or dial 911 if it is an emergency.\nQ: Can I pick up the Focus Blue payment card instead of having it mailed?\nA: No, but please contact UW study staff to discuss options if there is a problem with having it mailed.\nQ: Will I be notified if my data is compromised/breached?\nA: Yes, UW follows federal research guidelines for notifying participants in the unlikely event of a data breach.\nQ: What if I lose my phone or my phone breaks during the study?\nA: The team will stop collecting your data, and you should contact us to discuss the next steps.\nQ: Do I have to use the recovery resources or contribute to the discussion boards?\nA: You are not required to do so, but resources were selected to be helpful.\nQ: What if I don’t want you to know where I go?\nA: You can temporarily turn off your location data sharing by adjusting the app permissions under Research Study Settings. Remember, doing so will reduce your next bonus by $15.\nQ: What happens if I stop taking medication treatment for opioids during the study?\nA: Stopping your medication during the study will not affect your participation in any way, we just ask that you tell us the date when you stopped in the daily and monthly update surveys.\nQ: Why do you need to know my contacts?\nA: Part of the purpose of this study is to see how your interactions with different people in your life might affect your recovery goals. As a reminder, any data you provide us will be kept completely confidential and we will never contact any of the phone contacts you share with us.\nQ: What if I don’t want you to have my text/call information from one of my contacts?\nA: If you do not want to collect text/call information from a specific contact or conversation, you should delete the specific call or text within 30 days of the call being made or the text being sent. Participants should delete the info as soon as possible, as your data is recorded to our servers monthly.\nQ: What happens if I relapse during the study?\nA: A lot of people in recovery have relapses. Lapsing will not affect your payment or participation. Lapses are an important part of our study. We ask you to report lapses honestly on your daily surveys, since we are trying to identify the feelings, events, and behavior patterns that predict future opioid lapses.\nQ: How is it possible that my data could become known to someone not involved in the study if everything is on a secure server?\nA: Some of your data could be accessed if someone was to gain access to your unlocked phone. It is also possible, although very unlikely, that someone could access your data if they hack into the secure server. However, hacking the server is extremely unlikely to happen and even if it did happen, we have protected your data as outlined here.\nQ: How are you keeping my data private?\nA: Protecting your privacy is our highest priority. None of your data on our server is linked to your real name; instead it is all identified by coded participant numbers or user guid numbers, which is a 36-character random string of letters and numbers assigned to your data by your copy of the app.\nQ: Who has access to the secure servers?\nA: Only study staff will be able to access the servers. The servers are protected by secure password authentication protocols as well as UW staff password authentication.\nQ: What if I don’t feel like doing a study task?\nA: Your participation is totally voluntary, meaning that you do not have to complete study tasks if you do not want to. However, not completing the study tasks could reduce your bonus for the next month and our team may need to withdraw you from the study.\nQ: Will I be notified if I am not providing enough data?\nA: Yes, if you are not providing enough data, study staff will reach out to you to notify you that you are not completing the minimum requirements. If you continue to not meet minimum data requirements, our team may need to withdraw you from the study.\nQ: Is someone looking at where I go and who I talk to?\nA: No; no one on our study team looks at your data in real time to see where you go or who you talk to. We use computer programs to check that your data is being provided correctly, and to identify recent contacts and visited locations to ask you about. All of this is done by the computer without anyone looking at your data, which is kept completely confidential.\nQ: Who will be looking at my messages?\nA: No one will be looking at or reading your text messages during the study. After your participation has ended, your data will be identified only by a random coded number for the computer programs to use during our data analysis. Protecting your privacy is our highest priority.\nQ: Will I be able to track how many tasks I have completed?\nA: Yes. The task tracker at the top of the home screen will show you how many tasks you have completed for that day. When you complete all of the study tasks you have due, the task bar will turn green. You can also track the number of tasks you have completed over the month by tapping on the task bar and viewing the calendar. You will see a green star on days where you completed all of the tasks you had available and a yellow star on days where you completed some of the tasks. You can find a detailed walkthrough of the task tracker in Video Tutorials.\nQ: Will I be able to track how much money I have earned?\nA: Yes. You can track the balance and transaction history of your Focus Blue card by logging into your USA Bank Focus Account at https://www.usbankfocus.com/web/usbankfocus/login. Also, you will receive a monthly email from study staff letting you know how much you have earned in bonuses for completing the previous month’s study tasks.\nQ: Will you be able to see what I spend my bonus money on?\nA: No. We will never be able to see any of your Focus Blue transactions. We will also not be able to view the balance of your Focus Blue card.\nQ: What happens if my payment card is lost or stolen?\nA: Contact UW study staff immediately so that we can help you deactivate your lost card and get a replacement Focus Blue payment card.\nQ: How to use the recovery resources?\nA: You can find lots of helpful resources in “Recovery resources” in the main menu. These resources include media and music, guided relaxation, videos, library with recommended articles and books, games and other interesting apps. In “Resources Near You”, you will find links to several organizations that can help you find resources in your community. In addition, you could also create a list of reasons why you want to stay well in “My Motivations” on the resources page and watch your list grow as you continue your path to recovery.\nQ: How can I opt out of sharing my GPS, SMS, or Phone data?\nA: You can turn off data sharing in the app under Settings, then under Research Study Settings. The app will open the permissions page where you can toggle off sharing for any of these items. Remember, if you turn off data sharing frequently or for long periods of time, study staff will reach out to let you know that you are not meeting minimum data sharing requirements. If you continue to turn off data sharing, you may be at risk of being discontinued as a participant.\nQ: How can I earn the maximum bonuses?\nA: At the bottom of the task bar page in the app, you will find tips for earning maximum bonuses. Completing all your daily tasks and not turning off data sharing are two critical parts of your participation, so follow the study guides and suggestions from our research staff to earn a maximum bonus.\nQ: What if I switch phone carriers?\nA: Please contact study staff about your new carrier so we can continue to pay $50 a month towards your phone bill.\nQ: How to receive notifications from the STAR app or change the notification settings?\nA: In the STAR, select “the notification settings” and check “Enable device notification.” You can go to the setting page on your phone and select “notification” &gt;&gt; “all APPs” &gt;&gt; find STAR and turn the notification on.\nQ: If I forget to submit my surveys, could I go back and resubmit it?\nA: You would be able to resubmit the survey within the same day. If it’s on a different day, you wouldn’t be able to go back and resubmit.\nQ: My survey is showing that it’s half complete on the calendar. Would this impact the amount that I’m getting paid?\nA: Payment would not be impacted if their survey is shown as completed in the data_by_subid dataframe where you can find their monthly survey data using their subid.\nQ: My app keeps kicking me off since recent updates. What should I do?\nA: The issues you are experiencing may be related to a recent update Google released to an app used on all android devices, called “Android System WebView.” Updating this app (which can be found here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.webview)"

While I know some of this information may come across redundant, we are required to read the consent in its entirety to everyone interested in participating.”\nQ: “What do you mean by an ongoing cell phone plan?”\nA: By “ongoing cell phone plan”, we are talking about a cell phone plan that you or someone else pays monthly to the same cell service provider.\nQ: “What if I don’t need the monthly phone bill payment/ don’t pay my own phone bill?”\nA: No worries. We will provide the $50 for your phone bill payment regardless and do not track your spending.\nQ: “What will actually happen when I report lapses?”\nA: Reporting a lapse will not affect your participation in any way. The information is stored in our computer, and no one on our team will see it in live time.\nQ: “What if I miss a task?”\nA: It is okay and not unexpected that participants will miss a survey here and there. We ask that participants complete at least 6 daily surveys a week, but we do understand there are circumstances that may prevent this at times. Once a survey has closed, we will be unable to open it again. Completing surveys regularly is a requirement of the study, and a participant will be removed if this requirement is not met.\nQ: “Who will be looking at my text messages?”\nA: The individuals working on our team will never be able to read your messages. Instead, their contents will be stored in our computer, which will sort through everyone’s texts at the end of the study and pull key words, for instance “stress” before reported relapses or “happy” when talking to someone you reported was helpful to your recovery. Any personal contact information will be removed from the data before it is fed into the algorithm.\nQ: “What type of group level characteristics would you use/How would you use my text messages/ what does group level characteristics mean?”\nA: Group level data like the percentage of participants in our study of a certain gender, race, ethnicity, or level of schooling may be included in published reports. Private, personal information such as your name, location, or texts will never be shared with anyone outside of the study team.\nQ: “When would the Certificate of Confidentiality have to be broken?”\nA: If you explicitly communicate via an email, phone visit, or other direct communication that you or others are at risk. Examples of this would include reported child or elder abuse.\nQ: “How would being in this study help me?”\nA: This study is not a treatment and we cannot guarantee that it will serve any benefit to you, though we do hope that what we learn from this research will be useful for other individuals in recovery in the future.\nQ: “Can I delete anything I don’t want to share?”\nA: Yes. After completing a call, receiving or sending a text you do not want us to see, simply delete it from your call or SMS logs. You can also turn off your location sharing for a period of time (up to 6 hours) if you do not want us to see where you are going. Keep in mind we will never see any of this information in live time, and our team will never read your messages.\nQ: “What if I need to change phones will on study?”\nA: That is absolutely no problem, as long as your new phone is an android. Simply send us a message to indicate the change and we will assist you in getting STAR downloaded on your new device.\nQ: “What if my phone dies a lot/ I am often in areas with no service?”\nA: We understand there are circumstances wherein an individual’s phone may die or they may not have service to share data. If you anticipate you would not regularly be able to keep your phone on or connected to service, this study may not be a good fit for you.\nQ: Can I tell other people I’m in the study?\nA: You are free to share any information with whomever you feel comfortable, but we will not share any details of your study participation with anyone outside of the study team.\nQ: What if I know someone who may be interested in participating?“\nA: Wonderful! We are still actively recruiting. Please send your friend the link to our online screener survey (https://starstudy.wisc.edu/). If they are eligible, they will be able to schedule a call session with us to get enrolled.\nQ: How/when am I going to get paid?“\nA: Payment will be loaded directly to the debit card we will send to your address. You will receive payment once a month, on either the 15th or 30th depending on your start date.\nQ: How will I receive monthly phone bill payments?“\nA: The $50 for your phone bill payment will be issued directly onto your debit card with the rest of your monthly payment.\nQ: Can you put money directly into my bank account/ issue it a different way?“\nA: Unfortunately, no. We can only provide compensation via the payment debit card we will mail to your address.\nQ: How can I create a new email?\nA: Instructions for creating a Gmail.\n1. Launch your web browser and in the search bar, type “Gmail.com”. What do you see?\n2. If you are logged into a Gmail account already, you will need to log out of all Gmail accounts.\n3. Now what do you see on the screen? Answer: [if they see a list of their Gmail accounts].\n4. Tap the “Use another account” button.\n5. [If they see “Sign in to continue using Gmail”].\n6. Tap the “Create account” button. Then tap, “For myself”\n7. You should now see a form asking for your first and last name, username, to create a password, then create a password. When you are finished filling out the form. Then tap continue.\n8. On the next page, you will be asked to type in your phone number, a recovery email, your birthdate and your gender. When you are done with the form, please let me know. Tap next.\n9. On the next page, you will be asked to verify your phone number by having google send a code to your phone number. Tap send. When you receive a code, type that into the space provided, then tap verify. On the next page, you will be asked if you want to add your phone number to your account for use across Google services, you can tap either skip or Yes, I’m in. On the next page, you will be asked to agree to Google’s Privacy and Terms. When you are ready, tap the “I agree” button. You should be taken to your new email’s inbox.\n10. Now, please navigate back to the Qualtrics form.\nQ: How can I view the app that I downloaded on my android phone to find the STAR App?\nA: To see if you have successfully downloaded the STAR app, you can hit settings&gt;&gt;apps&gt;&gt;see all apps. You can scroll down the list and see if there is an app called “STAR”. If you find the app on the list, simply click on it and hit open.\n\nQ: If I don’t want to be a participate anymore, do I just delete the app on my phone? Does that prevent the research team get my data?\nA: If you are no longer interested in participating, you should notify the STAR research team and then delete the app. Deleting the STAR app or disabling permissions will prevent us from collecting data from your device."

Ali Susan runs the daily monthly script (INSERT LINKrun_monthly_payments.RMD) which on the 15th and 30th , which will generate an upload csv of participants who need payment, with the amounts. (including 1 week check-in payments for new participants and final visit payments for participants going off-study). i. Susan will use the WOG entries to determine if there is any compliance forgiveness and adjust the amounts accordingly. a.ii. This script will also generate lines in the payment log for each participant. If it is a batch upload, the total amount will be noted on each row for ease of reconciliation. b. After visual verification and manual edits if needed, Ali will upload this spreadsheet to the Focus Blue payment system. i. If the upload is being done a day after the script was run, please correct the dates in the payment log to match the actual upload date. b.ii. Also please check that the correct participants are included! c. Participants will be DMd’ by Ali to alert them of the payment.

    "text": "9.1 Opiate Use Patterns Review:\n\nThe purpose of this review is to inform how we ask people about opioid lapses (e.g., creation of time windows to report a lapse), routes of administrations, and types of opioids used for non-medical reasons Opiate Use Patterns First, opiate use patterns appear to be not as clear cut as one would think and there is little research on rates of drug administration. One study specifically examines opiate consumption at a heroin maintenance program in Geneva (Perneger et al., 2000). At this program heroin users are prescribed heroin and oral opiates as needed without any limit to the amount prescribed (wow!). On about 50% of total patient-days (days researchers documented consumption) patients used a combination of intravenous\n\nheroin and oral opiates (methadone and/or oral morphine; Perneger et al., 2000). This brings me to my first observation: participants may not be using just one opiate type. Perneger et al.\n\n\n\nfound that the average daily dose of IV heroin was about 500 mg taken in three injections throughout the day. This dose was slightly lower when taken in conjunction with oral opiates, which lowered IV users’ number of injections by one or two injections on average. One thing to note about this research is that it is on heavy users. So, my second thought is: participants who are relapsing after periods of abstinence may have different consumption patterns than regular users. This deviation could go either way – resulting in higher (i.e., they could binge one night on the entirety of drugs they pick up) or lower consumption (i.e., they have a slight lapse and only use one time). Evidence from the previously mentioned study supports the latter. Perneger et al.\nfound that when higher amounts of oral methadone was administered, fewer amounts and number of injections of IV heroin was documented. One patient, representing a typical pattern seen in the study, was able to decrease their daily injections from three injections to two to one by increasing their oral methadone dosage each time (Perneger et al., 2000). It is not clear, however, if this same pattern would be seen with other opioid maintenance medications. Unfortunately, this information is specific to IV usage and heroin. A 2004 study on opioid prescription pill users in a methadone maintenance program found that oxycodone and codeine were the most commonly abused pills (Brands et al., 2004). The same study reports that the average number of pills taken per day prior to treatment was about 20 – 22 tablets per day (Brands et al., 2004). Table 1 (taken from a different study) illustrates the average daily dose (mg), heaviest dose (mg) in a day, and route of administration used for various opiate prescription pills (Sproule et al., 2009).\n\n\n\nTable 1. From Sproule et al. (2009). Users of controlled-extended release oxycodone take on average higher daily doses than other opiate prescription pills. Other issues to consider are route of administration and variation in duration of the high for different opiates. According to an older research report put out by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, a typical heroin user will inject up to four times a day (National Institue on Drug Abuse, 2000). There does not appear to be the same available data for other routes of administration, but with the lower bioavailability of the drug seen in routes like smoking (Rook et al., 2006), it is likely they are used more frequently. Sniffing/snorting heroin is the second most common route of administration followed by smoking (National Institue on Drug Abuse, 2000). However, one newer study suggests sniffing is the most common route of administration, even surpassing injection (Ihongbe & Masho, 2016). With opioid prescription pills, chewing is the most common route of administration (Gasior et al., 2016; Sproule et al., 2009). However, some research suggests choice in route of administration is influenced by external factors. One study reported that route of administration varied as a function of both type of prescription opioid and whether the user was from a rural or urban community (Young et al., 2010). For example, rural users were more likely to snort hydrocodone tablets whereas urban users were more likely to swallow/chew the tablets (Young et al., 2010). One final consideration is the comorbidity of drug use common in opiate addiction (Brands et al., 2004; Monga et al., 2007). In one sample of 114 opiate users, 97% reported using other non-opiate drugs in the past 30 days, with alcohol (70%), cannabis (64%), and benzodiazepines (60.5%) being the most prevalent (Fischer et al., 1999). A larger study on 1075 opioid users reported that 54% of the sample regularly used benzodiazepines and 59% regularly used stimulants (Marsden et al., 2000). I do not think this is a concern currently for us; however, I think it is worth noting as it is possible that certain drugs may have synergistic effects with opioids resulting in more or less frequent drug administrations. Ultimately, this still doesn’t answer our question about the exact dosing frequency of opioid users who are not injecting heroin. To help guide us in making decisions for RISK2, I have also attached a table exhibiting the half-lives of various opiates (Table 2) and a table of duration of action for the same opiates (Table 3). From these tables you will see that the average duration of action for each of these opiates is around 3 – 6 hours. As a result, I would recommend that a time window of three hours is sufficient for measuring opioid lapses if needed. Furthermore, due to lack of research on opiate administration/use patterns it might be worth it to discuss whether we want to collect this information. For example, when a participant reports their lapse, they could also report the type of opiate (i.e., prescription pill, heroin, other) and the route of administration used (i.e., snorting/sniffing, smoking, IV, other).\nTable 2. From Trescot et al. (2008). Not listed above is heroin (diamorphine/diacetylmorphine) which has a half-life of .1 - .25 hours (https://www.aruplab.com/files/resources/pain-management/DrugAnalytesPlasmaUrine.pdf)!\nDrug Duration of action heroin 4 – 5 hours morphine 3 – 7 hours hydromorphone 4 – 5 hours oxycodone 3 – 6 hours (up to 12 hours with extended release) hydrocodone 4 – 8 hours fentanyl 1 hour codeine 4 – 6 hours buprenorphine up to 24 hours methadone prolonged use: 1 – 2 days https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6264977/ Table 3.

In introduction authors mention that “worst pain” item on BPI is commonly used as a single item measure. They do not expand on this thought though. I think this study is important because it seems to confirm that the research I found in my last draft can extend to non-cancer patients with varying degrees of pain. This is helpful because most of the research using the BPI (and single “worst pain” item) are on cancer patients.\n\n\nKeller, S., Bann, C. M., Dodd, S. L., Schein, J., Mendoza, T. R., & Cleeland, C.

The factor structure of the BPI was replicated in this sample and the relationship of the BPI to generic measures of pain was strong. The BPI exhibited similar relationships to general and condition-specific measures of health as did a generic pain scale (SF-36 Bodily Pain). Finally, the BPI discriminated among levels of condition severity and was sensitive to change in condition over time in arthritis and LBP [lower back pain] patients.” Above is from abstract, have not gotten access to this article yet. It was cited in the above study and seems to work to again support the BPI for use in non-cancer pain patients.\nAtkinson, T. M., Mendoza, T. R., Sit, L., Passik, S., Scher, H.

Not sure how this may affect what we are looking for."

Merely framing something as a game (e.g., using visual signals of gaming) seems to be motivating (e.g., Lieberoth, 2014). It might make sense for us to keep the current payment scheme but additionally reinforce completion of individual surveys with a more detailed points tracker (which when clicked can still show amount earned). • People should accumulate points for incremental progress. Every time people complete a survey / do something we want them to do, they should get points even if there is no financial earning. • We should provide positive messages and/or images upon completion of every survey. We need to positively reinforce completion of surveys. For example, when people complete a survey maybe we show a star on the daily survey button, when people complete all daily surveys in a week, the tracker bar could turn green. • We should take inspiration from existing apps (e.g., fitbit, strava). Private companies have poured a ton of money into testing progress trackers so it will be wise for us to look at how other apps function and use similar design features or language. • I didn’t find great papers on ‘streak’ feedback but I know this is popular on apps like Duolingo, so we might consider it (although it could backfire if people aren’t consistent… and maybe we don’t care that much about streaks) On messaging (e.g., if we incorporate text under the tracker or for notifications/reminders) • We should incorporate meaning/value information in messages. Occasionally reminding people why we want them to complete surveys will probably be motivationally beneficial (e.g., ‘Filling out surveys will help improve scientific understanding of relapse risk’; general support for this comes from theories of motivation (SDT, expectancy-value) but also supported by evidence in ‘gamification’ literature like Mekler et al., 2013). • We should vary message content based on progress. Shifting the reference point strategically can increase motivation (Wallace & Etkin, 2018). For example, we should be vague about goals when people are doing badly, so if people have completed 0 surveys we say something like “Complete more surveys to earn a bonus this week” rather than something like “Complete at least 5 surveys to earn a bonus this week” (or whatever our compensation scheme is). When people are doing well, we should be specific and focus on what remains versus how much progress they have already made… so e.g., when 6/7 daily surveys are done, rather than saying something like ‘You’ve completed six of seven surveys required to earn a bonus.’ we say ‘Complete one more daily survey to earn a bonus’ • If our in-app notifications are attention-grabbing, we should allow people to control the frequency of and/or disable them. If notifications annoy people, and if people habitually ignore notifications, they will not work."

    "section": "9.4 Risky Dates Review",
    "text": "9.4 Risky Dates Review\n\nThe purpose of this review is to summarize the literature surrounding meaningful dates and its relationship to substance use. It was also used to inform our decision to not ask participants to report potentially “risky dates”)\n\nEvent -Based Substance Use Often referred to in the literature as event-based or event-level substance use, there appears to be a general consensus that specific meaningful dates, events, and contexts are associated with increased likelihood of substance use on or immediately after said date, event, or context. Somewhat unsurprisingly, the majority of this event-based substance use research has focused on drinking patterns among college-aged populations (Stanesby, Labhart, Dietze, Write & Kuntsche, 2019). Consequently, the events that have received the most attention are those that have been identified as having a unique relevance to college-aged populations (21st birthdays, Spring Break, Frat Parties, Collegiate Sporting Events)(Patrick & Azar, 2018). Despite this methodological skew towards college-aged populations, I did come across a handful of event-based studies that included clinical, older, and more diverse populations. The events investigated in these studies included Holidays, Sporting Events, and Disaster/Terror Events.\nHolidays Predictably, people tend to drink more on certain holidays. In fact, a report by Mothers Against Drunk Driving put out a report on the top ten holidays with the highest number of alcohol related accidents 1. New Years Holiday, 2. Labor Day, 3. Fourth of july 4. Super Bowl Sunday 5. Christmas 6. Memorial Day 7. Fourth of July (2002) 8. Thanksgiving, 9. Halloween 10. St. Patrick’s Day (Lapham, Forman, Alexander, Illeperuma & Bohn, 2009). However, increases in high-intensity drinking may depend on the holiday in question. One study observed that on family-oriented holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmas, the number of young people who consumed alcohol increased but the average number of drinks consumed per person (counting only those who drank) actually decreased (Goldman,Greenbaum, Darkes, Brandon, Del Boca, 2011). In contrast, on holiday weeks that included a Halloween-like holiday, New Year’s Eve, and the Fourth of July, the average number of drinks consumed per drinker increased significantly compared with non-holiday weeks (Goldman et al., 2011). Though it is unclear whether these trends would translate into increased risk of opioid lapse given the considerable difference in social use of the two substances, if RISK 2 participants are polysubstance users, it is possible that increased risk of holiday drinking would increase the risk of opioid lapses. Interestingly, there is evidence that using medication to assist with substance use disorder can be helpful in reducing holiday substance use. One study investigating the effect of Naltrexone combined with psychosocial support on holiday drinking in treatment seeking populations with AUD found that taking Naltrexone was associated with near-complete abstinence during the holidays (Lapham et al., 2009).\nSporting Events Sporting events are also associated with risky drinking behavior. Among college football fans, particularly men, drinking on days of high-profile football games is as heavy as alcohol consumption on other well known drinking days, including New Year’s Eve and Halloween weekend (Neal & Fromme, 2007). Another study that looked at three years worth of drinking data found that heavy drinking male participants drank significantly more of Super Bowl Sundays compared to other heavy drinking days (Saturdays) across all three years, while women’s drinking was higher in only one of those three years (Dearing, Twaragowski, Smith, 2014). These findings suggest sporting events present a significant risk for risky substance use, especially among men. Disaster/Terror Events and Substance Use Given that we will have negative anniversaries as a category on the risky dates question, I looked at articles that covered the effect of disaster/terror events on substance use behaviors. Most of the research I found on this topic covered substance use in participants exposed to terror attacks, specifically 9/11 and the 1995 Oklahoma City Bombing (Vlahov et al., 2002; Pfefferbaum et al.,2002; Welch et al., 2014; DiMaggio & Galea, 2009). These studies generally found that those individuals who reported high or very high exposure to the event reported increased smoking and increased alcohol intake. Critically, these effects on participant substance use behavior were observed in those individuals with high or very high exposure to the event,up to a decade after exposure, regardless of PTSD diagnoses (Welch et al., 2014; Welch, Zweig, McAteer & Brackbill., 2017). Similar increases in substance use behavior have been observed in Jewish settlers who were directly injured during the intifada, particularly male settlers who had “sustained traumatic events with a great risk to personal integrity” (Keinan-Boker, Kohn, Billig & Levav, 2011). It is important to note that these studies were unable to establish any sort of causal relationship between the terror attacks and increased substance use. They do, however, suggest that traumatic exposure to a specific event is an important risk factor for risky substance use, especially if the individual is directly impacted by the event. \nWhile these studies demonstrate a significant relationship between increased substance use and certain meaningful dates and events, it is worth noting that the majority of these studies did not explicitly discuss relapse. Additionally, I did not find any research papers that had actually measured the relationship between sobriety anniversary and relapse. In the course of my search, I found a few non-research article sources, namely blog posts and online recovery resources (See References), that identify sobriety anniversaries, holidays, and recovery milestones as possible triggers for relapse. This dearth in the literature, especially as it relates to opioid use disorder, underscores the value of collecting this data as part of RISK 2. However, weighed against the clear burden of asking individuals to report risky dates and the lack of clarity as to what might constitute a “risky” date to individuals in recovery, we have decided not to ask about risky dates in RISK 2."

    "section": "9.5 Motivational Constructs Review",
    "text": "9.5 Motivational Constructs Review\n\nThe purpose of this report was to consider how the RISK 2 measures are directly and indirectly assessing motivation in the context of motivational construct literature\n\nMotivational Constructs in Risk 2 Across the daily, monthly, and intake survey, we have one item that directly measures participants’ motivation “How motivated are you to completely avoid using opioids for non-medical reasons?”. However, given the “growing consensus that motivation involves multiple constructs”, it is worthwhile to consider measuring additional “theoretically relevant predictors of motivation” (DiClemente, Doyle, & Donovan, 2009). Norozi et al. (2017) sought to investigate potential predictors of motivation by focusing on three cognitive constructs, perceived avoidance self-efficacy, perceived social support, drug quitting outcome expectancies. Of these three cognitive constructs, two are represented in the current RISK 2 surveys. Perceived avoidance self-efficacy refers to an individual’s belief in their ability to avoid drug use, particularly in high risk situations (Norozi et al. 2017). Several studies have shown that perceived avoidance self-efficacy is highly related to treatment motivation and commitment to abstinence (Germeroth et al. 2019; Chauchard et al. 2013; Laudet & Stanick, 2010). Because perceived avoidance self-efficacy is believed to fluctuate over the course of treatment, perceived avoidance self-efficacy is a better predictor of overall treatment outcomes when it is measured at multiple points during and after treatment (Ilgen etal, 2005; McKay et al 2013). In RISK 2, we ask participants to report their perceived avoidance self-efficacy in the Daily Survey using a single item (“How confident are you in your ability to completely avoid using opiates for non-medical reasons?”). In the Monthly Update and the Intake Survey, we have a set questions concerning Abstinence Confidence/Efficacy: “How satisfied are you with your progress toward achieving your recovery goals?”, How motivated are you to completely avoid using opioids for non-medical reasons?, How confident are you in your ability to avoid using opioids for non-medical reasons?, Do you intend to completely avoid using any other drugs? The other construct assessed in both Norozi et al. and the current RISK 2 measures is perceived social support. Norozi et al. used the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MPSS), a 12-item measure that asks participants to rate the general social support adequacy from family, friends, and significant other. Several studies have found that strong social support is associated with greater treatment retention, behavioral improvement during treatment, and better treatment outcomes (Broome et al. 2002, 2010). However, there is also evidence to suggest that the relationship between social networks and motivation may undermine recovery efforts if the participant maintains substance-using network members (Tracey et al. 2009). In RISK 2, Social Support will be assessed in the Intake Survey and Monthly Update using the Social Connectedness Scale, Relationship Assessment Scale, and individual items from the Social Networks Survey (In the past month, how satisfied are you with… The support you get from your friends, Your personal relationships). Additionally, the Contacts Report has four items that directly ask about social support (This person… is a person I can tell private things to, helps me when I need it, would support me through bad times, makes me feel good about myself even when mess up) as well as an item that asks participant to report whether interacting with the contact put their recovery at risk (How risky are your interactions with this person to your recovery goals?). The final cognitive construct Norozi et al. considered was outcome expectancies. Several studies have demonstrated that addicts’ perceptions of the costs and benefits of quitting can predict treatment motivation (Battjes et al., 2003; Chauchard et al., 2013; Jackson et al.,2003; Laudet & Stanick, 2010). In Norozi et al., the researchers created their own Drug Quitting Consequences Questionnaire, a 23-item measure “that assesses the costs and benefits of quitting substance use”. Following multivariate analyses, outcome expectancies emerged as a significant predictor of treatment motivation. However, a more recent study by the same group of researchers using the same scale found drug quitting outcomes was not a significant predictor of actual drug abstinence (Eslami et al, 2018). This inconsistency between predictors of treatment motivation and predictors of treatment outcomes is seen throughout the literature, with the predictive ability of outcome expectancies on either treatment motivation or treatment outcomes varying widely depending on factors such as the type of outcome expectancies measure, subject demographics, the stage of treatment and the behavior being assessed. The current RISK 2 measures do not directly assess outcome expectancies. While I did come across one scale that compressively assesses drug quitting outcome expectancies, The Perceived Risks and Benefits Questionnaire (PRBQ), it is both long (39 items) and highly specific to nicotine addiction (See Figure 1). However, it might be worthwhile to consider creating our own questions based on the different subscales within the PRBQ (i.e. Health Benefits, General Well Being, Self-Esteem) which could be added to the intake survey and monthly survey. I am imagining these items as being similar in theme to the items in the WHO Quality of Life Scale we are currently using, but with a more future-thinking orientation. Example Instructions: Use the scale (1= Very unlikely…7=Very Likely) to rate how likely each item would be if you were to achieve your recovery goals - I will lower my chance of developing future health problems - My overall well-being will be higher - I will have a greater sense of self esteem Ultimately, there could be some value in gathering information on how participants outcome expectancies might change over the course of RISK 2. Gathering such information would not only draw attention to the potential role of outcome expectancies in predicting opioid lapses, but also allow us to identify how outcome expectancies interact with constructs like self-efficacy and social support. However, for the narrower purposes of RISK 2 I did not find sufficiently compelling evidence that the value of measuring outcome expectancies would justify the added burden of a drug quitting outcome expectancies scale."

    "text": "10.4 Monthly Update\nThe monthly update that participants complete will differ slightly some months.\nStatic risk\nAt the beginning of the study, participants will complete a survey that includes measures of the following characteristics related to static risk: demographics; lifetime substance use history (items adapted from the World Health Organization Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test, Version 3); opioid treatment history; opioid use disorder DSM-V diagnostic criteria for the year prior to starting MAT; distress tolerance (items selected from the Distress Tolerance Scale); pain catastrophizing (items adapted from the Pain Catastrophizing Scale and Pain Catastrophizing Scale for Children); personality traits relevant to psychopathology (Personality Interview for DSM-IV Brief Form); adverse childhood experiences (items selected from the Adverse Childhood Experiences Questionnaire); and trauma experience.\n \nDynamic risk\nEach month that participants are on study, they will complete a survey that includes the following measures related to monthly changes in risk: life circumstances (e.g., employment status, living situation); social connectedness (adapted from the MOS Social Support Survey); romantic relationship quality (items selected from the Relationship Assessment Scale); psychiatric symptoms (items selected from the BASIS-32); pain and anticipated pain treatment (items adapted from the Wisconsin Brief Pain Questionnaire and the Pain, Enjoyment, General Activity Scale); stress (items selected from the Perceived Stress Scale); quality of life (items adapted from the World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment); substance use (adapted from the World Health Organization Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test, Version 3); opioid use; opioid recovery satisfaction and motivation; other recovery goals; questions about treatment use, adherence, and perceived efficacy including questions about MAT, self-help meetings, counseling, psychiatric medication, and detox or other inpatient residential treatment.\nFrom the second month forward, the monthly update will include questions about social contacts and visited locations (see below for more information).\nDynamic risk - Social contacts\nTo contextualize social contacts data (phone call and text/SMS message logs), participants will complete a short self-report survey about contacts that are identified as potentially meaningful to the person based on the duration and frequency of voice calls and text messages. This survey will ask people about the relationship type and closeness, the valence of typical interactions, and the extent to which interactions support or undermine their recovery.\nDynamic risk – Visited Locations\nTo contextualize visited locations data (GPS location), participants will complete a short self-report survey about the places they frequently visit (i.e., more than twice a month). This survey will ask people about the type of place, what they typically do there, the valence of spending time there, and the extent to which spending time there supports or undermines their recovery. When available, public information (e.g., via OpenStreetMap) about locations will also be used to contextualize GPS data. This contextual information (i.e., public data and the data the participant provides) will be used to create predictive features (e.g., changes in routine movement patterns, length of time spent at a specific place or place type) from the GPS location data.\n \nBurden\nIn the third month and the last month, participants will be asked questions about burden. Specifically, we will collect self-reported ratings on how much participants dislike a personal sensing signal and any positive or negative comments participants have about the signals. For the daily update, daily video check-in, and monthly updates, participants will also provide ratings on how much the signal interfered with their daily activities.\nIn the final month, the monthly update will only contain questions about burden and social contacts and visited locations.\nSee P:\\\\StudyData/risk2/methods/measures\n\n10.4.1 Timing of the monthly update\nFrom the CHESS team:\n\nThe logic treats the intake survey, personalized monthly survey, and monthly survey all as “monthly” surveys so if a person completes the intake survey during the window, they have to wait until the next window take the regular or personalized monthly survey.\n\n \n\nThen the following logic applies for deciding which survey to take is:\n\n\nIf they haven’t taken the intake survey, take the intake survey now.\n If they completed the intake survey and they have a personalized monthly survey to take, take the personalized monthly survey now.\nIf they completed the intake survey and they do NOT have a personalized monthly survey to take, take a regular monthly survey.\n\n \n\n\n10.4.2 Social contacts\nCriteria for identifying a phone number as a frequent contact:\n\nA number not identified as spam AND\nAt least one phone call (outgoing or incoming) more than 2 minutes long on two different days in a month OR\nA phone call (outgoing or incoming) of 15 minutes or more OR\nA one-on-one (not group) exchange of text messages (at least two outgoing texts and two incoming texts) during the month\n\n \n\n\n10.4.3 Visited locations\nCriteria for identifying a visited location: GPS observation with a next time of  &gt; 3 minutes or GPS observations within 60 meters of a GPS observation with a next time of &gt; 3 minutes\nIf people report that they do not recognize a location or were just passing by, we will ask them about it if it reappears on a future survey, but only one time (i.e., people will only need to report that they don’t recognize a location or they were passing by twice"

    "text": "13.2 Content\n\n13.2.1 Global Instructions\nThis is the first monthly update. It consists of different surveys that ask about aspects of your life and your recovery including your age, income, household, history of opioid and other drug use, drug treatment services, life events, and emotions. This first monthly update is longer than other monthly updates because it asks questions about your background. Completing this survey will take about 30 minutes and you will receive a $10 payment for completing it. Please read through all questions carefully and answer them honestly. All of your responses will be kept completely private.  The term “opioid” in these surveys refers to prescription opioids (like Oxycontin or Vicodin), synthetic opioids (fentanyl), and heroin. Below is a list of commonly used terms for these substances: Oxycodone (Oxycontin, Percocet, oxy, percs, O.C., rims, tires, greenies) Hydrocodone (Vicodin, Lortab, Norco, vike, bananas, fluff, hydros) Morphine (Kadian, Duramorph, MS Contin, miss Emma, monkey, white stuff, M) Codeine (lean, captain Cody, little C, schoolboy) Buprenorphine (Suboxone, Subutex, buse, sobos, strips, oranges) Hydromorphone (Dilaudid, Exalgo, smack, dillies, footballs, juice) Methadone (Methadose, Dolophine, tootsie roll, red rock, mud, dolls) Oxymorphone (Opana, biscuits, mrs. O, O bomb, octagon) Tramadol (Ultram, chill pills, trammies, ultras) Fentanyl (Sublimaze, Actiq, apache, goodfella, TNT) Heroin (black tar, black pearl, black, china white, dope, white lady, smack, snow, speedball)  When we ask about your use of opioids or other drugs, we often use the term “non-medical reasons” When you see this term, please think about your use of drugs to feel intoxicated or high. This includes taking more of a drug than you were prescribed, taking it more frequently than prescribed, or using a drug for reasons other than it was prescribed for.\n\n? ### Demographics [Instructions:] The first set of questions asks for some general information about you.  1.

But why are drug use rates spiking and what can we do about it? Neuroscientist Rachel Wurzman shares new research about how the brain reacts to opioids, replacing the sense of community and belonging human beings are losing.

This is referred to as co-existing conditions or comorbidities. Over half of the people with a drug and alcohol abuse also have another mental health issue. This doesn’t necessarily mean that one caused the other.\nThere are three ways to look at this; In some cases mental illness can lead to addiction. In other cases, drug and alcohol abuse can cause a mental illness or lastly both drug abuse and a mental disorder are both caused by a common risk factor.\n“Does it really matter how we talk about addiction?” -The old adage, “Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me,” implies words cannot convey harm. Today, however, more and more research on stigma is showing that words truly can hurt people, and in ways that the users of those words may not anticipate.

A year after the crisis was declared a public health emergency, it was reported that Americans are more likely to die from an opioid overdose than from a car crash. Women, who are most often the center of our care networks, have been affected in profound and myriad ways. They’ve buried children or taken in those of family members unfit to care for them. They’ve been overprescribed for pain management and underserved when the addiction set in. Over the course of the next eight weeks, we’ll be sharing their stories.\n“What is the impact of addiction” - Issues related to drug use are among the top public health problems in the U.S. and other nations around the world.\n\nDrug use can have an impact on health for the user, their social network, their community, society, and the economy.\nAccording to studies involving clinical experts and scientists (Nutt et al., 2010), alcohol is considered to be the most harmful drug due its indirect effects involving other people, followed by heroin and cocaine. Alcohol is also considered to be the third most harmful in terms of effects directly impacting the user, after heroin and cocaine.\nThe impact of drug use may be reduced with early intervention (Dennis et al., 2004). Alcohol and other drug use is the principle contributor to disability-adjusted life years lost for young people (Mokdad et al., 2016).\nEarly intervention may help minimize substance use disorder in adulthood, as 90% of adults with substance use disorder first used before the age of 18, and 50% started before the age of 15.\n\nWorkbooks\n“Challenging Automatic Thoughts”\n“Decisional Balance Exercise” - When people make decisions, they look at the costs and benefits of choices they could make.

Recounted in visceral, kinetic prose, and crafted with a forthrightness that rejects piety, cynicism, and self-pity, it brings us face-to-face with a provocative new understanding of the nature and the meaning of recovery.\nBy the time he entered a drug and alcohol treatment facility, James Frey had taken his addictions to near-deadly extremes. He had so thoroughly ravaged his body that the facility’s doctors were shocked he was still alive. The ensuing torments of withdrawal, and the never-ending urge to use chemicals, are captured with a vitality and directness that recalls the seminal eye-opening power of William Burroughs’s Junky.\nBut A Million Little Pieces refuses to fit any mold of drug literature. Inside the clinic, James is surrounded by patients as troubled as he is – including a judge, a mobster, a one-time world-champion boxer, and a fragile former prostitute to whom he is not allowed to speak ó but their friendship and advice strikes James as stronger and truer than the clinic’s droning dogma of How to Recover. James refuses to consider himself a victim of anything but his own bad decisions, and insists on accepting sole accountability for the person he has been and the person he may become–which runs directly counter to his counselors’ recipes for recovery.\nJames has to fight to find his own way to confront the consequences of the life he has lived so far, and to determine what future, if any, he holds. It is this fight, told with the charismatic energy and power of One Flew over the Cuckoo’s Nest, that is at the heart of A Million Little Pieces: the fight between one young man’s will and the ever-tempting chemical trip to oblivion, the fight to survive on his own terms, for reasons close to his own heart.\nA Million Little Pieces is an uncommonly genuine account of a life destroyed and a life reconstructed. It is also the introduction of a bold and talented literary voice.\n“Blackout: Remembering the Things I Drank to Forget”- For Sarah Hepola, alcohol was “the gasoline of all adventure.” She spent her evenings at cocktail parties and dark bars where she proudly stayed till last call. Drinking felt like freedom, part of her birthright as a strong, enlightened twenty-first-century woman.\nBut there was a price. She often blacked out, waking up with a blank space where four hours should be. Mornings became detective work on her own life. What did I say last night? How did I meet that guy? She apologized for things she couldn’t remember doing, as though she were cleaning up after an evil twin. Publicly, she covered her shame with self-deprecating jokes, and her career flourished, but as the blackouts accumulated, she could no longer avoid a sinking truth. The fuel she thought she needed was draining her spirit instead.\nA memoir of unblinking honesty and poignant, laugh-out-loud humor, Blackout is the story of a woman stumbling into a new kind of adventure – the sober life she never wanted. Shining a light into her blackouts, she discovers the person she buried, as well as the confidence, intimacy, and creativity she once believed came only from a bottle. Her tale will resonate with anyone who has been forced to reinvent or struggled in the face of necessary change. It’s about giving up the thing you cherish most – but getting yourself back in return.\n“Delicious Foods- By James Hannaham” -Held captive by her employers – and by her own demons – on a mysterious farm, a widow struggles to reunite with her young son in this uniquely American story of freedom, perseverance, and survival.\nDarlene, once an exemplary wife and a loving mother to her young son, Eddie, finds herself devastated by the unforeseen death of her husband. Unable to cope with her grief, she turns to drugs, and quickly forms an addiction. One day she disappears without a trace.\nUnbeknownst to eleven-year-old Eddie, now left behind in a panic-stricken search for her, Darlene has been lured away with false promises of a good job and a rosy life. A shady company named Delicious Foods shuttles her to a remote farm, where she is held captive, performing hard labor in the fields to pay off the supposed debt for her food, lodging, and the constant stream of drugs the farm provides to her and the other unfortunates imprisoned there.\nIn Delicious Foods, James Hannaham tells the gripping story of three unforgettable characters: a mother, her son, and the drug that threatens to destroy them. Through Darlene’s haunted struggle to reunite with Eddie, through the efforts of both to triumph over those who would enslave them, and through the irreverent and mischievous voice of the drug that narrates Darlene’s travails, Hannaham’s daring and shape-shifting prose infuses this harrowing experience with grace and humor.\nThe desperate circumstances that test the unshakeable bond between this mother and son unfold into myth, and Hannaham’s treatment of their ordeal spills over with compassion. Along the way we experience a tale at once contemporary and historical that wrestles with timeless questions of love and freedom, forgiveness and redemption, tenacity and the will to survive.\n“Drinking a Love Story- by Caroline Knapp” -Fifteen million Americans a year are plagued with alcoholism. Five million of them are women. Many of them, like Caroline Knapp, started in their early teens and began to use alcohol as “liquid armor,” a way to protect themselves against the difficult realities of life. In this extraordinarily candid and revealing memoir, Knapp offers important insights not only about alcoholism, but about life itself and how we learn to cope with it.\nIt was love at first sight. The beads of moisture on a chilled bottle. The way the glasses clinked and the conversation flowed. Then it became obsession. The way she hid her bottles behind her lover’s refrigerator. The way she slipped from the dinner table to the bathroom, from work to the bar. And then, like so many love stories, it fell apart. Drinking is Caroline Kapp’s harrowing chronicle of her twenty-year love affair with alcohol.\nCaroline had her first drink at fourteen. She drank through her years at an Ivy League college, and through an award-winning career as an editor and columnist. Publicly she was a dutiful daughter, a sophisticated professional. Privately she was drinking herself into oblivion. This startlingly honest memoir lays bare the secrecy, family myths, and destructive relationships that go hand in hand with drinking. And it is, above all, a love story for our times—full of passion and heartbreak, betrayal and desire—a triumph over the pain and deception that mark an alcoholic life.\n“Graceland- by Chris Abani” -The sprawling, swampy, cacophonous city of Lagos, Nigeria, provides the backdrop to the story of Elvis, a teenage Elvis impersonator hoping to make his way out of the ghetto. Broke, beset by floods, and beatings by his alcoholic father, and with no job opportunities in sight, Elvis is tempted by a life of crime. Thus begins his odyssey into the dangerous underworld of Lagos, guided by his friend Redemption and accompanied by a restless hybrid of voices including The King of Beggars, Sunday, Innocent and Comfort. Ultimately, young Elvis, drenched in reggae and jazz, and besotted with American film heroes and images, must find his way to a GraceLand of his own.\nNuanced, lyrical, and pitch perfect, Abani has created a remarkable story of a son and his father, and an examination of postcolonial Nigeria where the trappings of American culture reign supreme.\n“Gun, Needle, Spoon- By Patrick O’Neil” - This memoir follows a punk rock pioneer on his slide into drug abuse and life as an armed robber, all the way through life in recovery and what it’s like to look back on those times, knowing all the while that he is still under the threat of three strikes, a twenty-five-to-life prison sentence waiting. He has no choice but to deal with it all drug free.\n“Guts- By Kristen Johnston”- A harrowing and hysterical memoir by the two-time Emmy Award-winning actress from the hit television show 3rd Rock from the Sun.\n“It felt like I was speeding on the Autobahn toward hell, trapped inside a DeLorean with no brakes. And even if I could somehow stop, I’d still be screwed, because there’s no way I’d ever be able to figure out how to open those insane, cocaine-designed doors.”\n“High on Arrival- By Makenzie Phillips”- Not long before her fiftieth birthday, Mackenzie Phillips walked into Los Angeles International Airport. She was on her way to a reunion for One Day at a Time, the hugely popular 70s sitcom on which she once starred as the lovable rebel Julie Cooper. Within minutes of entering the security checkpoint, Mackenzie was in handcuffs, arrested for possession of cocaine and heroin.\nBorn into rock and roll royalty, flying in Lear jets to the Virgin Islands at five, making pot brownies with her father’s friends at eleven, Mackenzie grew up in an all-access kingdom of hippie freedom and heroin cool. It was a kingdom over which her father, the legendary John Phillips of The Mamas & the Papas, presided, often in absentia, as a spellbinding, visionary phantom.\nWhen Mackenzie was a teenager, Hollywood and the world took notice of the charming, talented, precocious child actor after her star-making turn in American Graffiti. As a young woman she joined the nonstop party in the hedonistic pleasure dome her father created for himself and his fellow revelers, and a rapt TV audience watched as Julie Cooper wasted away before their eyes. By the time Mackenzie discovered how deep and dark her father’s trip was going, it was too late. And as an adult, she has paid dearly for a lifetime of excess, working tirelessly to reconcile a wonderful, terrible past in which she succumbed to the power of drug use and the pull of her magnetic father.\nAs her astounding, outrageous, and often tender life story unfolds, the actor-musician-mother shares her lifelong battle with personal demons. She overcomes seemingly impossible obstacles again and again and journeys toward redemption and peace. By exposing the shadows and secrets of the past to the light of day, the star who turned up High on Arrival has finally come back down to earth – to stay.\n\n“How to grow up- By Michelle Tea”-As an aspiring young writer in San Francisco, Michelle Tea lived in a scuzzy communal house: she drank; she smoked; she snorted anything she got her hands on; she toiled for the minimum wage; she dated men and women, and sometimes both at once. But between hangovers and dead-end jobs, she scrawled in notebooks and organized dive bar poetry readings, working to make her literary dreams a reality.\nIn How to Grow Up, Tea shares her awkward stumble towards the life of a Bona Fide Grown-Up: healthy, responsible, self-aware, and stable. She writes about passion, about her fraught relationship with money, about adoring Barney’s while shopping at thrift stores, about breakups and the fertile ground between relationships, about roommates and rent, and about being superstitious (“why not, it imbues this harsh world of ours with a bit of magic”). At once heartwarming and darkly comic, How to Grow Up proves that the road less traveled may be a difficult one, but if you embrace life’s uncertainty and dust yourself off after every screw up, slowly but surely, you just might make it to adulthood.\n“In Pain: A Bioethicist’s Personal Strugfle with Opioids- By Travis N Rieder” - A bioethicist’s harrowing memoir of opioid dependence and withdrawal–and a clarion call to challenge the status quo of healthcare and of medicine itself–[this book] reveals the lack of crucial resources and structures to responsibly manage pain in America. Travis Rieder’s terrifying journey down the rabbit hole of opioid dependence began with a motorcycle accident in 2015. One month and several surgeries later, Travis was on painkillers around the clock. The drugs he received were both miraculous and essential to his recovery–for a time. But the most profound suffering Travis would endure arrived months after the accident, when he went into acute opioid withdrawal while following his physician’s orders. Over the course of four excruciating weeks, Rieder experienced firsthand, all day long and through the night, what it means to be ‘dope sick’–the absolute physical and mental agony that is opioid withdrawal. Clueless how to taper off these intensely powerful painkillers, Travis turned to his doctors, who suggested that he go back on the drugs and simply try again later. Rieder’s experience exposes a dark secret of American healthcare: the crisis currently facing us is actually an unsurprising and inevitable consequence of a culture deeply conflicted about opioids and a system grossly inept at managing them. As he recounts his own brutal story of pain and pills, Rieder provides the fascinating history and trajectory of these drugs, from their invention in the 1800s through a long period of opiophobia to the eventual warm embrace of these medications that led to an environment of aggressive, even reckless, prescribing. Here rigorous examinations of the science of pain and addiction are considered alongside analyses of the systemic and cultural barriers we must overcome if we are to address the problem effectively on both a local and a global scale.\n\n[This book] is not only a gripping personal account of drug dependence, but also a groundbreaking exploration of the complex causes of our opioid epidemic and a path to resolving the crisis through provider education, policy, and alternative treatment advocacy. Rieder makes very clear that the opioid crisis exists against a backdrop of real, debilitating pain that providers cannot ignore but can learn to treat more effectively and safely. Pain management is profoundly broken in America, and the result is devastating for both patients and those at risk for addiction. But we do not, Rieder argues, have to accept this situation. By changing medical practice, adopting reasonable drug policies, and altering the way we view those who take drugs (both prescription and not), we can reduce suffering and save lives; we can give people the care they deserve.\n“Permanent Midnight- By Jerry Stahl”- Jerry Stahl’s seminal memoir of drug addiction and a career in Hollywood, Permanent Midnight is a classic along the lines of Hubert Selby, Jr.’s Last Exit to Brooklyn. Illuminating the self-loathing and self-destruction of an addict’s inner life, Permanent Midnight follows Stahl through the dregs of addiction and into recovery. In 1998, Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, and Maria Bello starred in a film version of Permanent Midnight to much acclaim. Nic Sheff, author of Tweak, writes the introduction to this edition.\n“Terry: My Daughter’s Life- and- Death Struggle with Alcoholism- By George McGovern” -Just before Christmas 1994 Terry McGovern was found frozen to death in a snowbank in Madison, Wisconsin, where she had stumbled out of a bar and fallen asleep in the cold. Just forty-five years old, she had been an alcoholic most of her life. Now, in this harrowing and intimate reminiscence, her father, former Senator George McGovern, examines her diaries, interviews her friends and doctors, sifts through medical records, and searches for the lovely but fragile young woman who had waged a desperate, lifelong battle with her illness.\n\nWhat emerges is the portrait of a woman who was loved by everyone but herself. Surrounded by devoted parents, caring siblings, and two young daughters of her own, Terry maintained an appearance of control but was haunted by the twin demons of alcohol and depression. Her story is a heartbreaking tale of her attempts at sobriety, the McGovern family’s efforts to help her—and the failure of both. With courage and compassion, George McGovern addresses a private tragedy with an honesty rarely achieved by a public figure, looking candidly at his inability to save his child. A primer for other families who live with addiction, McGovern’s book is filled with wisdom and an understanding that can come only from sharing his tremendous loss with others.\n“Unwifeable: A memoir- By Mandy Stadmiller” - Provocative, fearless, and dizzyingly uncensored, Mandy spills every secret she knows about dating, networking, comedy, celebrity, media, psychology, relationships, addiction, and the quest to find one’s true nature.

She is newly divorced, thirty-years-old, with a dream job at the New York Post. She is ready to conquer the city, the industry, the world. But underneath the glitz and glamour, there is a darker side threatening to surface. The drug-fueled, never-ending party starts off as thrilling…but grows ever-terrifying. Too many blackout nights and scary decisions begin to add up. As she searches for the truth behind the façade, Mandy realizes that falling in love won’t fix her—until she learns to accept herself first.\n\n\n21.3.4.2 Resources Near You\nTreatment Resources\n“Addiction Center: Locate a treatment center near you” - Recovery on your own is not only dangerous during the initial detox, it is also more likely to result in drug use later on.

    "text": "21.4 Study Information\n\n21.4.1 STAR Guidelines\nThe purpose of the STAR Guidelines is to set expectations for Participant interactions with the discussion board and in communication with STAR Staff.\n\nBy joining STAR, you agree to abide by all rules and guidelines when communicating on STAR message boards, direct messages, and during phone calls with STAR staff. Our Guidelines are designed to ensure all participants and staff are protected and are treated professionally and with respect. All in-app messages, posts, and phone calls with staff are regularly reviewed by the STAR team, and staff will remove any discussion post, comment, or individual member who does not adhere to stated rules and guidelines.\n\n\nGuideline 1: Always Use Respectful Language - It is important to us that the STAR app and procedures create a space where individuals feel comfortable, safe, and empowered to communicate while supporting their recovery. Therefore, STAR will not tolerate harassment, hate speech, violent or vulgar remarks, or exclusionary language of any kind on app discussion boards, direct messages, or via phone/email/direct message communications with STAR staff. This includes hurtful or targeted language against someone on the basis of their race, ethnicity, national origin, disability, financial class, religious affiliation, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, or any other individual characteristics. Whenever you are posting on message boards, sending direct messages, or talking on the phone with STAR Staff, remember that there’s a human being on the other end.\n\n\nWhat we expect from you: For the safety and comfort of all study staff and participants in the STAR study, we expect you to use respectful language in all communication. This includes not making any inappropriate, flirtatious, threatening, or rude comments to study staff or other study participants.\nIn Direct Messages with study staff and in posts to the Discussion Board, do not use offensive, obscene, or sexually explicit language, jokes, or stories. Do not use derogatory names or labels (directly or implied) when referring to individuals or groups. Any use of this language will result in an immediate warning and possible subsequent removal from the STAR Study\n\n\nWhat you can expect from us: Every member of the STAR team is committed to maintaining a high standard for communication with participants. We will always use polite and respectful language as outlined above when communicating with you. If you are ever concerned that a member of the STAR team is not meeting this standard, please to not hesitate to share that concern. Our team will review all language from staff and participants and remove content that does not meet this standard.\n\n\nGuideline 2: Use a Professional Communication Style\n\n\nAll posts should be professional and courteous. Accepted internet standards for professional online communication include not using all-caps (or SHOUTING) in your posts, maintaining a civil tone, respecting the privacy of others, and staying on-topic.\n\n\nWhat we expect from you: Please communicate with staff and other STAR participants as you would in a professional work setting. You may send direct messages to staff with questions, comments, or concerns about the STAR study at any time. However, all Direct Messages to staff should be on topic and professional in tone. Similarly, posts and replies to topics on discussion boards should remain on topic and maintain a professional tone. To stay on topic, please do not overshare personal information or ask personal questions to STAR staff or other participants and limit your communication to STAR procedures or posted discussion topics. To maintain professional tone, we ask that you do not post or comment on discussion boards, direct message staff, or call/email STAR staff when you are feeling highly emotional or are under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Please wait to send all communication until you feel you are in a calm and comfortable state of mind.\n\n\nWhat you can expect from us: Our team is committed to responding to all messages from our participants in a prompt and professional manner. In addition to the standards outlined above, you can expect that any direct message or phone call received by STAR staff to be responded to within 1 - 2 business days of the message being received. If you are ever reaching out to report an issue with the STAR app, you will not be penalized for study tasks missed while waiting for a response from study staff.\n\n\nGuideline 3: Safe Communication/Privacy\n\n\nCommunications on the STAR app and with STAR staff are secure to protect your privacy. Since posts and comments on message boards are able to be viewed by other authorized STAR users, we request that all users follow general internet safety guidelines to prevent unintentional sharing of personal information to others. When writing on STAR discussion boards, avoid sharing personal or private information that you would not be willing to share with a total stranger. For example, you should never share your full name, your phone number, your address, or your social security number. If you would shred it, don’t share it. STAR staff will remove any posts where someone is attempting to gather personal or private information from other users on the platform.\n\n\nWhat we expect from you: Due to the personal nature of the STAR study, we ask that you avoid sharing personal identifying information about yourself or any other participants. In the course of your participation, you may discover that you know other people also participating in the study. While you are free to discuss details of your participation in the study with people on other platforms, please be mindful of the information you are sharing within the STAR app to make sure that you are not accidentally sharing personal information about someone else. The STAR team reserves the right to remove anything that that they deem to contain or attempt to gather personal identifying information. Any questions about what may be too sensitive to post to discussion boards should be directed to the STAR Help account via DM.\n\n\nWhat you expect from us: You should expect that we will always consider your safety to be our top priority. This includes having multiple protocols in place to protect your privacy, including storing your contact information in a locked location that is separate from your data, restricting access to your contact information, and labeling all of your data with an anonymous id number, (a full list of the privacy protections can be found in the Consent Form). Additionally, we will never post or share any information about you with any other STAR participants. Even if you know other participants in the STAR study, we will never share any information about participants with any other participants.\n\n\nReview Process - We maintain a record of all messages and posts sent within the STAR app, as well as all phone and email conversations with STAR staff outside of the app. These records are regularly reviewed by our STAR team to ensure communication follows our stated guidelines. If a member of the STAR team detects language or behavior that does not follow our guidelines, a private written warning will be sent to individuals following their first offense. A second offense may result in the person’s account being removed from the app and withdrawal from the STAR study. Study staff will always be available to discuss decisions about warnings or withdrawal. These guidelines are meant to serve as general rules for the type of behavior that will result in a warning or possible withdrawal from the STAR study. This is not an exclusive list. The STAR team reserves the right to determine if a participant has behaved inappropriately.\n\n\n\n21.4.2 How To\n\n\n21.4.3 Privacy Policy/Informed Consent"

Staff and RAs will be responsible for routine moderation. Participants are instructed that inappropriate posts will be removed, and repeated violations may result in withdrawal.

    "section": "22.2 Dynamic content",
    "text": "22.2 Dynamic content\n\nDynamic content can be updated without an app update. Most dynamic content can be edited within the app by people with admin accounts (and for some features, all users). The following content is dynamic: discussion group posts, recovery resource articles, and surveys.\n\nThe survey content is dynamic. You can update the surveys at any time and the changes will get downloaded to the app the next time the participant opens the app (if it is completely closed aka swiped away) or if they have had the app open for 6+ hours.\nNotification text is dynamic but requires a CHESS developer to update the text. \n\n\n\n22.2.1 Updating the Recovery Resources\nThe survey admin account has rights to add, remove, or edit articles. In order to change the structure (e.g. changing the names of sections or adding / removing sections), STAR dev team will need to make that change and release a new version of STAR.\n\n\n22.2.2 STAR Survey Builder: Instructions & Features\nLogging In\n\nTo access the development server, go to: https://test.chess.wisc.edu/star\nClick “Already a participant? Tap here to login” then use your existing account name and password\nOnce you login, click on the Site Settings link on the homepage or in the menu (the little icon in the upper right hand corner). Then go to Site Settings &gt; Surveys &gt; Survey Editor.\n\nImportant Notes\n\nIf your browser refreshes while you are editing, you will end up on a blank page that refreshes endlessly. You will have to visit the main page, log in again, and navigate back to the survey you were editing.\nIt is recommended that you save often using the “Save” button at the bottom of the page. Unlike Qualtrics this does NOT save as you go.\nIn addition to saving often, it is helpful to occasionally exit the editor and re-enter. Questions may occasionally disappear and doing this often allows you to catch which questions go missing.\n\nNote. disappearing questions are likely caused by a guid conflict which can occur when saving happens to quickly (creates duplicate guids). These types of silent server errors can be seen as a red message in Chrome’s Devtools. To open Devtools in a chrome browser hit Ctrl Shift J (on Windows) or Ctrl Option J (on Mac). This should open a sidebar with a tab called console. If a red message appears during survey editing take a screen shot of the error.\n\nNote. that if you have multiple nodes (which is required for branching), you must specify the destination node for all nodes (the default is End of Survey so your survey will end after the first node if you don’t specify this).\nNote. that if you import a survey from a previous survey export, you MUST reassign all of the conditional displays because ALL of the item identifiers change when you reimport.\n\n\n22.2.2.1 Rich Text Editing\n\nRich text editing is possible in the Survey Builder and in Direct Messages/Discussion Boards by using Shortcodes.\nLink to list of available shortcodes: https://docs.google.com/document/d/13BrsOJsDJzIJ0bnkIP_Aoj4T4liNP3rOOYg8zPfQm_U/edit\n\n\n\n22.2.2.2 Dynamic Survey Construction\n\nDynamic surveys are created with three scripts written by Susan (make_monthly_people; make_monthly_places; upload_monthly_dynamic_only). These scripts are located in the staff_scripts folder of the analysis_risk2 github repository. This script pulls surveys from STAR, inputs the right information, and publishes a survey for each person. When a participant is assigned a study_id, &lt;study_id&gt; will be used to look for the most recently published survey whose survey identifier starts with “monthly-&lt;study_id&gt;”.  Surveys need to have their survey_status set to “published” with a publish_date set in unix time, seconds since the epoch.\nThe scripts that create data used in dynamic surveys are in the “staff_scripts” folder of the “analysis_risk2” GitHub repository\n\n\n\n22.2.2.3 Surveys and Survey Editor Terminology\n\n“Node”: Contains a set of Pages and Questions. Similar to a Block in Qualtrics. This is the first item you must add.\n“Page”: Contains a set of Questions. When a user navigates through the survey, they will jump from Page to Page. You must add a Node before you can add a Page and you must add a Page before you can add a Question.\n“Loop & Merge Question”: A question that lets you specify a Node to loop through for each option selected by the user.\n“Looping Node”: Node being looped through from a Loop & Merge Question.\n\n\n\n22.2.2.4 Question Types\nRadio\n\nSelect only one option\nAnswer options can have subquestions (i.e., if “Other” is selected, a textbox appears that is labeled “Please specify”)\nMost items will be radio format (including likert scale questions).\n\nCheckbox\n\nSelect all that apply\nAnswer options can have subquestions (i.e., if “Other” is selected, a textbox appears that is labeled “Please specify”)\n\nLoop and Merge Checkbox\n\nThings that the editor may let you do but can cause problems when taking the survey:\n\nNo questions should come after a Loop & Merge question on the same page.\nDon’t use a Loop and Merge question within a Looping Node.\nQuestions within Looping Nodes should not jump to other nodes.\n\nRecommended Best Practice for adding a Loop & Merge question as of April 2020.\n\nCreate a Loop & Merge question as the last question on the last page of a Node 1\nCreate a Loop Node 1 and add your pages/questions\nCreate a new Node 2 after Loop Node\nSet both Loop Node 1 and Node 1 to go to Node 2.\n\nMaking replacements within content:\n\n“${&lt;question identifier&gt;:answer}” will be replaced by the answer selected by the user from the Loop & Merge question\nIf more than one checkbox answer is selected all questions in looping node will be displayed for answer 1, then all questions will be displayed for answer 2, etc.\nWhen using replacement questions in looping node, start any new questions (without replacement) in a new node (outside looping node). This prevents survey respondent from having to answer the question multiple times (i.e., when multiple answers are being looped into the replacement question).\n\nData will appear as:\nExample\n\nLoop & Merge Checkbox Question (ID: foo)\n\nContent: Select all that apply\nPossible Answers: Foo1 (ID: foo1), Foo2 (ID: foo2), Foo3 (ID: foo3), Foo4 (ID: foo4)\nAnswers selected by user: Foo1, Foo2, Foo3\n\nWithin Looping Node\nText Question (ID: bar)\n\nContent: “Tell us more about ${foo:answer}”\nFor Foo1, content will be “Tell us more about Foo1”\nFor Foo1, content will be “Tell us more about Foo1”\nFor Foo1, content will be “Tell us more about Foo1”\n\nCheckbox (ID: baz)\n\nContent: “Select all that apply for ${foo:answer}\nPossible answers:\n\nBaz1 (ID: baz1), Baz2 (ID: baz2), Baz3 (ID: baz3)\n\nFor Foo1, “Select all that apply for Foo1”\n\nUser selects “Baz1”\n\nFor Foo2, “Select all that apply for Foo2”\n\nUser selects “Baz1, Baz3”\n\nFor Foo3, “Select all that apply for Foo3”\n\nUser selects nothing\n\n\n\nData will appear as\n\nRow 1\n\nquestion_guid: foo\ncontent: foo1, foo3\n\nRow 2\n\nquestion_guid: bar\ncontent: { “foo1”: “Bar1”, “foo2”: “Bar2”, “foo3”: “Bar3” }\n\nRow 3\n\nquestion_guid: baz\ncontent: { “foo1”: “baz1,”, “foo2”: “baz1,baz3,”, “foo3”: “” }\n\n  NOTE: Checkbox selections always have trailing commas\n\n\n\n\nConditionally Displayed Loop and Merge Checkbox\n\nAllows you to set conditions for displaying questions in a looping node based on answers to a Loop and Merge checkbox question\nAll of the rules and best practices from Loop and Merge Checkboxes described above apply here\nFor each question within the looping Node, set the condition for displaying question on the line that reads “Conditions for Displaying Questions (Optional)”\nExamples can be found in Monthly Survey (monthly_final) on the STAR site\n\ndemographics_change (Node 1, pg. 5, Q1)\nwhoassist _month_1 (Node 3, pg. 2, Q2)\n\n\nLikert Scale\n\nLikerts can be created with 2 to 15 options\nYou can include a “Not applicable” option\n\nThis option can be given a custom label\n\nYou can specify Start and End anchor labels, but also as many intermediate anchor labels as desired.\n\nAdditional Labels are spread between the start and end labels evenly.\nAdditional Labels can be blank.\n\nResponse items are unreadable as Likert. Radio format preferred.\n\nContent\n\nText information only\n\nSimple Date Picker; Multi-Date Picker; Simple Date Time Picker; Generic Date Time Picker\n\nBoth multi-date and single date pickers are available, with and without time pickers\nA check box allows you to specify if future dates should be permitted. By default they are disabled.\n\nText Input\n\nSmall text box\n\nText Input (Only Allow Numeric Input)\n\nNumeric only text box\n\nText Area\n\nLarger text area to allow multiple entry lines\n\nSelect a US state\n\nAs indicated\n\nPicture Options - Experimental\n\nUnknown - not used\n\nUpload a picture\n\nNot used\n\nSelect Age\n\nDrop down menu of integers beginning at 1 with increment of 1.\nNot currently used.\nFor age questions use Selectbox and define age bins.\n\nEx. “Under 10”, “10-13”, “14-17”, etc.\n\n\nSelectbox\n\nDrop-down menu of predefined categories.\nAdd response for each category that will be included in drop down.\n\nEx. “Less than weekly”, “1-2 times per week”, “3-4 times per week”, “5+ times per week”"

    "section": "24.1 Obtaining Raw Data",
    "text": "24.1 Obtaining Raw Data\nDownload the gps, sms / call, and survey data through the website by logging in as an administrator (like survey admin) then clicking on the Site Settings button from the homepage and clicking on the Data Exports button. When you click Run for each export, it will download the most current data in the database. There should already be data in each export.\n  Create your own Test Site account:\nApp site: https://test.chess.wisc.edu/star\nEnter in Test Site ID: 4867\nADMIN account details:\nClick “Login” under “Already a participant?” and enter credentials from LastPass\n\n24.1.1 Automating Downloads\nSee git repo for the scripts used to download data for this project. This section contains general descriptions of the process.\nFrom Adam: \n\nHere are some instructions for automating the data exports using HTTP requests.\nThe script you create will need to make an HTTP POST request to the following URL for the test site: https://test.chess.wisc.edu/star/data-exports/query/run Once we have the live site fully set up, I will send you the URL for it and you just need to switch out the URL in the script.\nI recommend the program Postman for testing HTTP requests, particularly POST requests.\nYou will need to pass the following parameters to &lt;Website URL&gt;/data-exports/query/run\ntoken: A user access token that is generated when a user logs in and who has access to the data exports.\nfile_type: Type of file returned. Takes one of the following: “csv”, “xlsx”, “json”\nquery: MySQL query to run on the database. Will only allow read-only queries e.g. SELECT\nSee the attached screenshot for how that would look in Postman.\nThe easiest way to get a user access token and a query to automate is to use what already exists in the Star site’s data exports.\n\nLog into the site and navigate to the Site Settings &gt; Data Exports page.\nOpen the browser’s Developer Tools / Inspector (Opera, Chrome, Firefox, etc) or Web Inspector (Safari) by right clicking on some text and clicking Inspect or Inspect Element. Click on the Network tab. This tab records what network requests are made. Click the Run button next to the export you would like to automate.\nYou should see one or two rows appear in the Network tab called “run” or “data-exports/query/run”. If there are two, look for the one whose Request Method is “POST”. Depending on the browser, you may need to select Persist Logs to have them appear. After you find the row, look for the Request Payload or Request to see what parameters were passed in the HTTP Request.\nOnce you have the request data, copy the token, file_type, and query to your script or copy them to Postman and click “Send”. You should get a 200 response status code with the data in the response body / payload. After that, you are good to go (in theory)!\n\nIf you encounter problems, let Adam know. Also, this involves working directly with the MySQL database without you really knowing what columns/data are available to you. If you have questions, feel free to ask and I can give you more information about the database structure.\nThank you,\nAdam\nP.S. The user access token will persist until the user manually logs out. If a user simply closes the browser, they will not be logged out and the token should last forever. If you run into problems with the token expiring (i.e. a status code of 403, unauthorized), let me know.\nP.P.S. You can use normal read only MySQL syntax in your queries such as SELECT, JOIN, UNION, GROUP BY, ORDER BY. One thing to note, for tables, you will need to wrap them in { } which is not standard MySQL syntax. We use prefixes on the tables and the curly braces sort of skirt around that issue.\n\n\n\n24.1.2 SMS/Voice\n\nSMS is pushed to the server immediately on opening the app and messages can be deleted by users within 30 days after which they will be ‘frozen’ on the server.\n\nFrom Adam…\n\n\nYou can use the following to filter SMS data http requests by guid and date:\nhttps://test.chess.wisc.edu/star/logging/get-sms-calls-by-user?type=%25&show_deleted=false&user_guid\n\nFor “sort_by”, you can leave that blank or not even include the sort_by=. It will default to logs being listed by the send_date from most recent to least recent. You can also use the following options: “” =&gt; sent date desc then create date desc “create_date asc” =&gt; Logs from least recent to most recent create dates “create_date desc” =&gt; Logs from most recent to least recent create dates “sent_date asc” =&gt; Logs from least recent to most recent sent dates “sent_date desc” =&gt; Logs from most recent to least recent sent dates [Describe final sampling rate and characterize battery usage]\n\n\n\n\n\n24.1.3 GPS\nFurther updated information recorded for each location to help in debugging location tracking issues. The following fields are encoded to save database space.\n\nhacc: Horizontal accuracy in meters\nspd: Speed in meters\nii: Is app interactive aka open or has notification (0 = false, 1 = true)\nipsm: Is device in Power Saving mode (0 = false, 1 = true)\nic: Is device charging (0 = false, 1 = true, -1 = not known) (Android 23 API+)\niibo: Is app ignoring battery optimizations (0 = false, 1 = true, -1 = not known) (Android 23 API+)\nidim: Is app in Device Idle Mode (0 = false, 1 = true, -1 = not known) (Android 23 API+)\nlsm: Location Power Save Mode (-1 not known, integer, for values see documentation) (Android 28 API+)  (Experimental - not sure what this does yet)\nFor more information about ““hacc”” and ““spd”“, see https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Location\nFor more information about ““idim”“,”“ii”“,”“ipsm”“, and”“iibo”“, see https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/PowerManager\nFor more information about ““ic”“, see https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/BatteryManager\nFor ““lsm”“, see https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/PowerManager#getLocationPowerSaveMode()” ### Daily Video Check ins From Adam…\nLike the other downloads, you can make a request to a url. This will provide you with information about the video check-ins collected. There is a colum called “video_checkin_remote_storage_url” which provides you with the location of the file. You will need to make a request to that URL to download the file.\nhttps://test.chess.wisc.edu/star/data-exports/export/video-checkins?file_type=%3Cfile_type\nGET Parameters:\n&lt;token&gt;: Must be a valid user token. This user needs to have the User Administrator permission enabled. &lt;file_type&gt;: The type of file to download. Takes “json”, “csv”, or “xlsx”. Defaults to “csv” if none is provided\n\n\n\n24.1.4 Storing Raw Data\n\nData will be stored in aggregate and downloaded on a schedule (e.g., weekly). There will not be subject-level folders in the raw data folder.\nDynamic survey analyses will be done on data pulled directly from the CHESS server and not stored raw on our server."

    "text": "(The purpose of this SOP is to welcome participants to the study, remind them of the purpose/goals of the study and what it means to be a participant)\n\n \n“On behalf of the STAR research team at the University of Wisconsin- Madison, I want to first and foremost thank you for agreeing to be a part of our research study. You are now part of a group of volunteers who use our mobile health app and share their smartphone data with our team. This will allow us to find better ways to support people in recovery from opioid use disorder.\nThe purpose of this study is to develop a system that can tell when people are at greater risk of slipping in their recovery. Our team will look for warning signs in the information that you and other volunteers provide. With this information, we can study the feelings, events, and behavior patterns that can lead to using opioids for non-medical reasons. In the future, this system could warn people when they are at risk and hopefully help people avoid future problems with opioids.\nAs part of the study, here is what we ask of you. We ask that you stay logged into the STAR app on your phone and keep that phone paid for and charged. Get into a good routine of charging your phone every night. We also ask that you set your permissions to share your phone call data, text message data, and your GPS location data with the STAR app. Then, we also ask that you fill out a short survey every day called the daily update, and finally, that you fill out a longer survey every month called the monthly update.\nRecovery is a journey and people often experience many ups and downs. We want to develop a system that can help people through the ups and downs. That is why we ask people to be part of our study for an entire year. A year is a long time, but we are here to help you stick with it.\nWe hope that you complete all the study tasks, every day. But at a minimum, we ask that each month you complete at least 20 daily updates, the monthly update, and that you don’t disable sharing your phone call, text message, and GPS data for more than 12 hours each month.\nIf you decide you do not want to be part of the study at some point, or you are not able to complete most study tasks, that is okay too. You can leave the study whenever you want.\nThe STAR App you will be using is a research app and is still in development. That means there is a chance that the app may not work with your cell phone. If the app does not work with your phone or does not allow us to collect the data that we need, we may need to stop your participation early.\nWe encourage you to explore the STAR app and personalize it for your recovery. Using the STAR app menu options, you can change your profile by tapping on your profile picture and change your STAR settings to your personal preferences. Also, we encourage you to check out the app features like the Recovery Resources and Coping with Cravings. We also have a Peer Support feature that will allow you to connect with other participants in the STAR study. These features were designed by our team to support recovery.\nYou can learn more about the study and the STAR app in our other videos and on our website. In the STAR app, the “Study Information” tab in the menu has all our study videos, the link to our study website, and our email address. There, you can also find the consent form for the study.\nWe are so excited to have you join STAR. Thank you again for taking part in this research!"

    "title": "27  Daily Update Tutorial Script",
    "section": "",
    "text": "(The purpose of this video tutorial is to walk participants through how to complete the Daily Update)\n\n \nIn this video we are going to walk-through how to complete a daily update. The daily update is a short survey that will be the same every day. It first asks if you have any use of opioids to report and then asks questions about your experiences and feelings in the last 24 hours and the upcoming week.\nThe daily update should take less than a minute to complete. You can complete the daily update at any time but we would like you to try to complete it at the same time everyday so that it is part of your routine and you don’t forget to complete it. A great time to complete the daily update is in the morning as you are getting ready for the day.\nEvery day, you will get a notification to complete the daily update when you open the Star app. The daily update will be available at 5am Central Time and you will have until 5am the next day to complete it.\nTo complete the daily update, you simply click the “Daily Update” button on the homepage of the STAR app or click the “Take now” button on the daily update notification.\nThe daily update has some instructions on the first page. These describe what the questions will be about and describe what we mean when we ask about “using drugs for ‘non-medical reasons’”. When we ask about using drugs for non-medical reasons, we are asking about whether you have taken drugs to feel high or intoxicated, taken a drug that you weren’t prescribed, taken more of a drug than you were prescribed, taken a drug more frequently than prescribed, or used a drug for reasons other than why it was prescribed. We are not asking about your use of prescribed medications for opioid use (for example through your Medication Assisted Treatment program) or pain medications that you have taken exactly as prescribed by your doctor. We are only interested in your use of medications or drugs for the non-medical reasons we just described. When you are ready to continue, tap the orange “Continue” button.\nAfter this page of instructions, the questions will begin. The first question is the most important question that we ask you on any survey. This question asks you whether you have used any opioids for non-medical reasons that you haven’t already reported in a previous daily update. So, for example, if you miss a few daily updates and you used opioids for non-medical reasons in that time, you should report those times in the next daily update you complete. Your answer to this question is protected by The Certificate of Confidentiality for this project. We will keep it completely confidential and not share this information with anyone. Answering yes or no to this question does not affect your participation or payment in any way either. You can continue to participate regardless if you use or do not use opioids at any time. For more information about privacy protections, please visit the STAR study website.\nIf you indicate “Yes” meaning that you have used opioids for non-medical reasons that you have not yet reported, the next question will ask about the dates and times of your use. You will see four options for different blocks of time for each date between when you started the study and when you are filling out the daily update. The first block of time on any given day is the very early morning, from midnight to just before 6 in the morning. The next block is the morning from 6 in the morning to just before noon. The third block is the afternoon and early evening, from noon to just before 6 at night. The last -block is the evening, from 6 at night to just before midnight. You should select the block of time and date for each occasion you have used opioids. If you used opioids more than once, select all the times when you used opioids. If you are reporting a slip that happened more than a few days ago, you can use the side arrows to find the right dates.\nIt is very important that we know when you have used opioids for non-medical reasons. The main goal of our projects is to help people trying to recover from opioid use. Knowing when people in our project have used will allow us to see what circumstances lead to the opioid use for people in recovery.\nWe understand that it can be hard to report opioid use, especially right after you use. So, you can report that you have used opioids for non-medical reasons at any time and whenever you feel comfortable reporting it. However, we ask that you try to report it as soon as possible so that you don’t forget about it. If you are not sure whether you have already reported any specific time you used opioids for non-medical reasons, you should report it again. It’s okay to report the same time slip twice. This is much better than missing a report of your use.\nAfter you answer the question about your use of opioids for non-medical reasons, there will be two more sets of questions. The first set will include questions about the previous 24 hours. That is, the questions ask about your experiences and behaviors since the same time on the previous day. This will include questions about use of drugs other than opioids, medication use, urges, mood, and other experiences over the past 24 hours.\nThe final set of questions asks about the future rather than the past. You will be asked to think about your recovery over the next week. Specifically, you will be asked to rate how confident you are in your ability to completely avoid using opioids for non-medical reasons and how motivated you are to completely avoid using opioids for non-medical reasons.\nAfter that you are done with the daily update. You will see a message that says, “Thank you! You have now completed the daily update.”\nYou can only complete the daily update once a day.\nYou can earn up to $33 per month for completing daily updates, paid to your study debit card. For every daily update you complete, you will earn a small payment ($0.75 per daily update). If you complete at least 6 daily updates each week, you will earn the maximum payment of $33 per month.\nTry to complete a daily update every day and answer every question on the daily update. Completing the daily update is a very important aspect of your participation in this study. To continue participating in the study, you will have to complete at least 20 daily updates every month.\nDuring the study, you might be in a situation where you can’t complete the daily update, like if you lose your phone. If that happens, please email or call study staff as soon as you are able to let us know.\nThe STAR app will alert us if you are missing a lot of daily updates or not answering every question. If that happens, we will reach out to you to ask if everything is okay and to help you with any issues that you are having with the daily update."

    "title": "28  Monthly Update Tutorial Script",
    "section": "",
    "text": "(The purpose of this video tutorial is to walk participants through how to complete the Monthly Update)\n\n \nVideo: https://www.youtube.com/embed/HeQ8Gb1sGls\n“Today, we are going to walk-through how to complete a monthly update. The monthly update is a longer survey that asks you questions about yourself, people in your life, your experiences, and your behavior. You will complete the monthly update every month that you are part of the study.\nAs soon as the monthly update becomes available, the STAR app will notify you to complete the monthly update. The update will take about 20 minutes to complete. Please try your best to complete it as soon as it becomes available. The STAR app will remind you that you have a monthly update to complete every time you launch the STAR app.\nHere is how you’ll complete the monthly update:\nOpen the monthly update by tapping the “Monthly Update” button on the homepage of the STAR app or click the “Take Now” button on the monthly update notification.\nThe monthly update is similar to the daily update, but much longer. That is why you only do it once per month.\nWe recommend you set aside 20 minutes and find a quiet, private place to complete the monthly update.\nThe update consists of several questionnaires. The questionnaires are made up of questions about yourself and your experiences, people in your life, and your recovery. To complete them you’ll choose an answer that best matches you and your experiences. We would like you to read every question carefully and answer them honestly.\nThe first monthly update will take about 30 minutes to complete. This survey is longer than later monthly updates you will be asked to complete for the study and will ask extra questions about you, like your age, history of drug use, and other aspects of your life history. These questions will only be asked on the first monthly update.\nStarting with the second monthly update, you will also be asked to provide information about how the people you text and talk with on the phone and the places you go make you feel and whether they support your recovery or put your recovery at risk.\nWe have an automated system that identifies the phone numbers that you text and talk with often and the places you go often using the data you share with us. We will only ask you about phone numbers and people that are frequent for you.\nAs we ask you questions about phone numbers, we will show the phone number and the contact name that is saved in your phone if there is one. You will be asked to describe who the phone number belongs to. You will be able to select an answer from a list of different options like “spouse or significant other”, “child”, “parent”, “friend”, “mental-health related”, and “work-related”. You can also indicate that you don’t know the number or that none of the options fit.\nThen, you will be asked questions that can help us understand how important this person is to your recovery. You will be asked about how close you are with the person, how pleasant and unpleasant calls or texts with them are, and how much calls or texts with them help and harm your recovery from opioids.\nWhen you fill out the monthly update you might see phone numbers that you do not recognize or that are not meaningful, like if the number is for a restaurant you order food from. If you do not recognize the phone number, you can mark it as “unknown”. You will also be able to indicate that none of the options for describing the contact fit if you need to.\nFor each place you go frequently, you will be asked similar questions. We will show you the place on a map and give you the approximate street address. First you will be asked to describe the type of place from a list of options. The options are “my home”, “someone else’s home”, “a shelter, group home, hotel, or other temporary place I stayed”, and “a restaurant, business, public place, or other non-residential place” meaning some place you did not stay. You will also be able to say that you do not know the place or that you were just passing by and did not spend time there. Then, you will be asked questions to help us understand how important visiting that place is to your recovery. You will be asked how pleasant and unpleasant going to the place is and how much going to the place helps and harms your recovery.\nThe location data we use and the system that we use to detect places you go frequently from those data are not perfect. Our goal is to show you places that you have been to twice or more in the last month. Sometimes, we may make errors. We may ask about places you did not go, like somewhere you only passed by.\nFor example, we may ask you about a long stoplight you wait at on your drive to work. This is not really a place you visited, so you would select that you “do not recognize this location or were just passing by”.\nOther times, we might not get the address of a place you go exactly right because location data is not always perfectly precise. For example, we may ask you about the building next door to where you work. You can assume that we are trying to identify the places you go frequently. In this past example that would be your workplace, not the building next door. Please answer the questions about that frequently visited place.\nYou will start answering these questions about phone numbers and places in your second monthly update. Each month we will only ask you about new phone numbers and new places that we have not previously asked about. There may be a lot of phone numbers or places in the first monthly update where you answer these questions. In future months there should be fewer and fewer numbers and places that we have not already asked about.This will make the future monthly updates quicker to complete.\nIn addition to the questions about phone numbers and places, and all the questions that make up the rest of the monthly update, some months we will ask you questions about your experience as a participant in the study. For example, we may ask about what it is like to use the STAR app and complete study tasks.\nYou may not be able to answer all the questions on the monthly update at once. If you need to take a short break while completing the monthly update, tap the “Exit” button and confirm “Yes” to save and return to the home page. The next time you open the monthly update, it will pick up where you left off.\nOnce you are done with the regular monthly update, you will see a message notifying you that you have completed the monthly update and that you will be receiving an additional $10 on your next study task payment, paid to your study card.\nPlease try to complete every question on the monthly updates. We understand that some of the topics we cover in the monthly update may be difficult to answer. However, we will keep all of your answers to all the questions completely confidential. Your answers will also not affect your participation or payments in any way.\nCompleting the monthly update is a very important aspect of your participation in this study. To remain a participant in the study for the entire year, you will have to complete at least nine monthly updates. If you fail to complete a monthly update within four weeks of it becoming available or skip more than 5 questions on a monthly update, it will count as a missing monthly update. That means you will not receive the monthly update payment for that month, and you will receive an email from study staff notifying you have missed important study tasks. Additionally, if you miss two or more monthly updates in a row, you may also be at risk of being removed as a participant.\nDuring the study, you might be in a situation where you can’t complete the monthly update, like if you lose your phone. If that happens, please contact us immediately.”"

Similarly, posts and replies to topics on discussion boards should remain on topic and maintain a professional tone.\nOur team is committed to responding to all messages from our participants in a prompt and professional manner. In addition to the standards outlined above, you can expect that any direct message or phone call received by STAR staff to be responded to within 1 - 2 business days of the message being received. If you are ever reaching out to report an issue with the STAR app, you will not be penalized for study tasks missed while waiting for a response from study staff.\nGuideline 3: Safe communication/privacy\nCommunications on the STAR app and with STAR staff are secure to protect your privacy. Since posts and comments on message boards are able to be viewed by other authorized STAR users, we request that all users avoid sharing personal or private information that you would not be willing to share with a total stranger. For example, you should never share your full name, your phone number, your address, or your social security number. While you are free to discuss details of your participation in the study with people on other platforms, please be mindful of the information you are sharing within the STAR app to make sure that you are not accidentally sharing personal information about someone else. If you would shred it, don’t share it.\nReview Process Our team keeps a record of all messages and posts sent within the STAR app, as well as all phone and email conversations with STAR staff outside of the app. These records are regularly reviewed by our STAR team to make sure communication follows our stated guidelines.\nIf a member of the STAR team detects language or behavior that does not follow our guidelines, a private written warning will be sent to individuals following their first offence. A second offence may result in the person’s account being removed from the app and withdrawal from the STAR study.\nStudy staff will always be available to discuss decisions about warnings or withdrawal. These guidelines are meant to serve as general rules for the type of behavior that will result in a warning or possible withdrawal from the STAR study. The STAR team reserves the right to determine if a participant has behaved inappropriately."

    "text": "31.1 Script\nIn this video I am going to tell you how to complete a daily video check-in.These videos are being collected to provide risk signals from what you say, how you say it, and your facial expressions.\nThe daily video check-in is not a required study task, and your participation will not be negatively affected if you decide not to do any video check-ins.If you decide that you enjoy doing them, we will pay you extra for each video check-in you complete.\nThe daily video check-in should take about one minute to complete. You can complete the daily video check-in any time, but we would like you to try to complete it about the same time every day so that it is part of your routine, and you don’t forget to complete it. A great time to complete the daily video check-in is in the morning as you are getting ready for your day.\nIn the STAR app you will get a notification to complete the daily video check-in every day when you open the app. The daily video check-in will be available at 5am Central Time and you will have until 5am the next day to complete it.\nTo complete the daily video check-in, you simply click the “Daily Video Check-In” button on the home page of the STAR app or click the “GO” button on the daily video check-in notification.\nWhen you open the daily video check-in, you will see the prompt and instructions at the top of the page to help you record your video. The prompt is, “Please find a quiet and private place to record yourself. When you are ready, talk for up to a minute about a rose (a success or positive event), a bud (an event you are looking forward to in the future), or a thorn (a challenge or negative event)\nHere are the steps that you should follow:\nFirst, find a place that is mostly quiet and somewhere relatively quiet where you feel comfortable sharing freely\nDecide what you are going to share: a rose (something positive), a bud (something positive in the future), or a thorn (something negative). You can share anything that comes to mind in the moment. Your check-in can be, related to your recovery or not, positive or negative, or a big event or a small event.\nStart recording by hitting the “Record Video” button.\nUse the camera in selfie mode – so that the camera is facing you. There will be a button you can tap to switch to have the camera facing you while you are still looking at the screen.\nLook at the phone while you speak.\nStart your video by saying what you are sharing: “My rose for today is …” , “My thorn for today is …” or “My bud for today is …”\nThen say what the rose, bud, or thorn is and explain why you chose it and how it affects you.\nTalk like you are talking to a friend.\nYour check-in does not have to be long, but it can be if you would like. For most people, it will take about 30 seconds\nStop recording by tapping the shutter button. Then, tap the checkmark to submit it.\nYou’ll see a message that says: “Successfully uploaded video.”\nWe will sometimes check that you have recorded videos and that there are no issues with them but we won’t watch them in full or right away. So, the video recording is not a way to talk to STAR staff or ask for help. If you want to talk to STAR staff, visit the study information tab.\nAdditionally, the videos will be stored on our secure server and will be destroyed once we have analyzed the data at the end of the study.\nOnce again,you are not required to complete daily video check-in’s.\nFor every daily video check-in you complete, you get 50 cents. That means if you complete all daily video check ins, you’ll get $150 added to your payment card each month."

    "text": "32.2 Aurora Screening Call\nHi, my name is [name] and I am a research associate at Advocate Aurora Health. One of your healthcare providers recently spoke to you about participating in a research study through University of Wisconsin-Madison. They communicated to us that you might be interested in learning more about it. Is now a good time to talk about the study?\nGreat! This is a 12-month study for people who are in recovery from opioids. It will involve using an Android smartphone app that was designed to help people in recovery.\nPeople who participate in the study will be paid for completing study tasks through the app and for the phone calls they have with study staff. People who complete all study tasks will receive about $70 a month. The STAR team at UW – Madison will also pay $50 a month to people’s cell phone providers to help cover their monthly phone bill.\nBased on what I have shared, are you interested in hearing more about participating in the study?\n[If yes, continue]\n[If no, thank and disconnect- no payment]\nThe next step will be setting up an enrollment appointment to connect you with the UW-Madison STAR study team. Before we schedule that though, I would like to go through some screening questions with you to make sure you are eligible for the study.\n[Begin REDCap screening questions, starting with “Do you have an Android smart phone?” ]\n[If ineligible, thank and disconnect- no payment]\n[If eligible, schedule onboarding meeting and text the participant the call-in details]\n\n32.2.1 Introduction – Aurora\nHi this is [name], a research associate at Advocate Aurora Health. Is now still a good time to talk?\nGreat! Today I’m going to provide you more details about a study being conducted by the University of Wisconsin-Madison\nIf after hearing more about the study you want to participate, I will connect you to the STAR team at UW-Madison. Then, a research technician at UW-Madison who will finish your enrollment and make sure you have all the information you need to get started as a participant. The entire process will take about 30 minutes.\nAre you interested in learning more about the study?\n\n\n32.2.2 Introduction – UW\nHi my name is [name] and I am calling from the University of Wisconsin-Madison about the STAR study. Is now still a good time to talk?\nGreat! First, I’m going to tell you more about today’s session. I’m going to be telling you about our research study and if you are eligible and interested, I will enroll you. The entire process will take about 30 minutes.\n\n\n32.2.3 Description of the study\nThis is a 12-month study for people who are in recovery from opioids. It will involve using an Android smartphone app that was designed to help people in recovery, but it is not a treatment study, which means we will not be providing any treatment.\nPeople in the study will do tasks using the app. These will include filling out short daily surveys, a longer survey once a month, and sharing smartphone data.\nPeople who are part of this study need to keep their phone bill paid and need to be consistent about keeping their phone charged.\nThis study will ask people about their experiences with drugs, so it is important that those who take part feel comfortable honestly answering questions about their use of opioids and other drugs.\nAll the information the study collects will be kept entirely anonymous and stored on the University’s secure servers, accessible only to members of the study team. A lot of participants ask us, “if I report a lapse, how do I know law enforcement, CPS, or my treatment provider won’t find out?” Well, to prevent this, we’ve obtained a Certificate of Confidentiality, which means we are protected by the National Institute of Health from being forced to share study information with anyone outside the study team”.\nPeople who participate will be paid for completing daily and month study tasks. People who complete all the study tasks will receive about $70 a month, and we will also pay $50 a month to help people cover their monthly phone bill.\nParticipants will also get paid for the phone calls they have with STAR study staff a total of three times during the study. This session counts as one of the phone calls.\n\n\n32.2.4 Aurora Participants Only:\nParticipants who are recruited through Advocate Aurora Health will be asked to share the results of any urine drug screens that they complete through Advocate Aurora Health while they are part of the study. Even though Advocate Aurora Health will share this information with the study team, the study team will not share information with participants’ healthcare providers at Advocate Aurora Health.\nSo, based on what I have shared, are you interested in hearing more about participating in the study?\n[If yes, continue] [If no, thank and disconnect. No payment]\nConfirm phone OS- UW only\nWonderful! So, before we continue further, I’d just like to just verify that you do have an Android phone and that you have that phone available to you now?\n[If no]\nUnfortunately, our app only works on Android phones, which means I will not be able to enroll you at this time. I apologize for the inconvenience but greatly appreciate your interest in our study and hope you have a wonderful day. [no payment given]\n[If yes]\nOk great! In that case you can sign up for the study if you wish and we can go ahead and continue.\nConsent\nIn this part of the visit, I am going to tell you a little bit more about the study and then give you the chance to formally agree to join it.\nI’m going to send you a link to an online consent form. Sometimes it takes a while to come through so don’t worry if you don’t see it yet. You won’t need it until a little later, and if you have already received it, I’m going to ask that you hold off on opening it for now.\nConsent Survey Link:\nUW: https://uwmadison.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6zzSu1ddmyfH46G\nAurora: INSERT REDCap Link\nNow I am going to tell you about the study goals and about the risks, benefits, and protections associated with being a participant in the study.\nThe goal of this study is to develop a relapse risk-prediction system. In the future, this system could help people in recovery from opioids by giving them real-time updates about their risk of using.\nSo - In this study, [the STAR team at UW – Madison] will be collecting data from people who are in recovery from opioids because they want to identify the feelings, events, and behavior patterns that can lead to using opioids and other drugs.\nA lot of people in recovery have “slips,” where they use opioids but are still committed to recovery. These slips are sometimes called “relapses,” “episodes,” or “lapses.” And while slips may seem to come out of nowhere and take people by surprise, research has found evidence of warning signs like really stressful events, big changes to life circumstances, changes in moods, or being around friends or places that remind people of their past use.\nSo- the goal of the STAR study is trying to find new warning signs. They are looking for warning signs in two different kinds of information.\nFirst, they are looking for warning signs in information that people provide about their own experiences – so these are things like people’s moods, experiences of stress, urges to use, and how much people want to avoid using. This type of information will come from daily and monthly surveys that participants fill out.\nSecond, they are looking for warning signs in information that people do not need to tell them about, and that people might not even know about themselves. For example, people’s recent messages or where they go could contain a warning sign. People’s routines and patterns or changes to their routines and patterns could also contain warning signs. They gather this type of information from smartphone data including phone calls logs, texts, and location.\nSo far, I have given examples of times when people are at greater risk of using opioids, but in this study, they are also looking for positive signs. People tend to do better in recovery when they are happy, have meaningful contact with other people, and when they have healthy habits and routines.\nFor this study to predict future opioid slips, they will need information about when slips have happened. This means that participants in this study will be asked every day if they have used opioids; and when they used the opioids.\nAurora Participants Only:\nParticipants who have been recruited from Advocate Aurora Health will provide even more information about slips by sharing the results of any urine drug screen tests that they take while they are part of our study. Although the treatment providers here Advocate Aurora Health will share this information about slips with the STAR team at UW-Madison, the STAR team will not share anything back with Advocate Aurora Health or anywhere else. In addition, the results of the urine drug screen test we send to the STAR team will not affect your participation in the STAR study.\nSo that is the main purpose of the study. Do you have any questions?\n[Answer questions until they have none]\nNow I’m going to describe what people are asked to do as participants in our study.\n\nParticipants download the STAR app onto their phone and have to keep that phone paid for and charged.\n\nEvery day they fill out a short survey that asks how they are doing.\n\nOnce a month, they fill out a longer survey that asks about their thoughts and experiences in the last month.\n\nAurora Participants Only: Participants recruited from here at Advocate Aurora Health also be asked to allow Advocate Aurora Health to share the results of any urine drug screen tests taken at Advocate Aurora Health.\nYour participation in the STAR study has no effect on your treatment at Advocate Aurora Health. The STAR team will never share any information about your participation or enrollment status with us.\nI’d also like to tell you more about what we’ll be doing with the smartphone data that people share with us. After I tell you about each item I’ll pause and ask if you have any questions.\n\nPeople will be asked to give the app permission to access their phone data, text messages, and their location data.\n\nFor phone data, our computer will be able to see the numbers of people you call or message frequently, and the name you have given them in your Contacts, if any. For example, we might see “this participant texted or spoke with 608-555-1234 four times over the last month. This person is saved in their contacts as Joe Smith”. We will use this information only to ask you generic questions about whether talking to this person is harmful or helpful to your recovery.\n\nFor text messages, our computer is able to read only the text of SMS messages you have sent or received. The computer cannot see any images you might send in texts, or any messages sent using other apps like Snapchat or Facebook. The study team cannot see your actual texts in real time; and we cannot “read your messages”. Near the end of the study, our computer will sort through the words in the messages to tell us general things about people’s messages. For example, “people in this study used the word ‘stressed’ in their texts much more often before they had a slip” or “this person used the word”happy” more often when talking to a person they told us was helpful to their recovery”\n\nFor location data, our computer will be able to look through the GPS points recorded by your phone and use those to identify places you have spent time at. For example, the computer might tell us “this person has visited 101 Main Street two times in the last month”. We will use this information only to ask you generic questions about whether visiting this location is helpful or harmful to your recovery. We cannot “see where you are” in real-time and won’t know anything about these places other than what you choose to tell us. I also want to reassure you that you will be able to delete any phone logs or SMS messages that you don’t want us to see, and you will be able to turn off your location sharing if you don’t want us to see where you go for a period of time.\n\nParticipation in the STAR study is totally voluntary. The study lasts up to one year, but you can stop being part of the study at any time. To remain enrolled, people have to complete most tasks, meaning all monthly updates and at least 6 daily updates per week, and share their phone, text message, and location data. If someone is not able to keep up with tasks or does not want to share their data anymore, we will talk with them and may decide to stop their participation early.\nIt is important that you know that any use of opioids or other drugs has no effect on your participation. You can continue to participate regardless of when or how many times you might use opioids or other drugs. It is only important that you honestly report any opioid or drug use when asked about it in the surveys.\nNext we’ll go over study risks and benefits. There are no major risks related to participation in this study. If you decide to participate, the main risk is that someone might see your information who should not.\nFor this reason, we are very careful and have created safeguards regarding how your data is stored and accessed. Protecting your data and privacy is our top priority, and we are overseen by a group at the University of Wisconsin-Madison that exists to protect and help research subjects. With their guidance, we follow careful protocols for storing, using, and sharing any information that could be used to find out who participants are.\nSome examples of how we will protect your information and reduce the risk that someone might see it:\n\nWe store your contact information like your name and address in a locked location that is separate from the study data.\n\nWe label study data with an anonymous study id number.\n\nWhen we share results and data with other researchers, we will not share information that could be used to find out who participants are, like their location data.\n\nWe will only ever give group summaries of demographic information like people’s age, gender, and race or ethnicity.\n\nThere are no direct benefits of taking part in this study. The STAR app that participants use was designed to help people in recovery and might help you, but we are not treatment providers, and this study is not a treatment. Of course, our team does hope that in the future, what we learn in this study will be used to improve treatments for other people in recovery.\nWe will compensate people who participate in the study for as long as they choose to do so. If you decide to enroll, you will earn:\n+ $20 for the first phone visit (that’s this visit)\n+ $10 for a phone call in a week to check in about the study\n+ $10 for a phone call at the very end of the study\nThere will be only 3 calls total over the entire 12-month course of the study. This call counts as one of those three calls. To be clear, we will NOT be calling or checking-in on you regularly aside from the surveys you complete in-app.\nFor every task you complete in the app you will earn payments, and you can also earn bonuses for meeting target goals, with payments up to about $70 per month.\nAgain, we will also pay you an additional $50 a month to help cover the cost of your monthly phone bill.\nCompensation will be provided via a payment debit card that we will mail to you after successful download of the STAR app. Once compensated for the completion of your initial calls and training, you will receive payment on your designated date once a month.\nAll of that said, this study was not designed to make money for the research team or anyone else. If you participate in the study and if the research team develops products from this study, you will not receive any profits. It is also important to let you know that one member of the STAR research team partially owns the company that makes the study app, and as such they may financially benefit from this research study.\nBased on what I have shared, what questions do you have for me? [Answer questions]\nThe information I just gave you about the study goals and the risks, benefits, and protections are things that we make sure everyone who is thinking about joining the study hears and understands.\nThe next step of the process is to make a formal decision about whether you want to be part of the study. In a minute, I’ll have you click on that link I sent you, which will show you a Consent Form with all the information I just reviewed stated in more technical language. Then you’ll be asked if you are ready to decide if you want to participate. If you do, you’ll be asked a few questions, and these will take information that we need to pay you and help make sure our study includes different types of people.\nThen, finally, you’ll download the app and set up an account.\nNow is the time to open that link that I texted you. You should see a document that says “Consent Form” at the top. You can take as much time as you like to read it over and let me know when you are done. I can sit quietly here in case you have any questions. You’ll also be able to download a copy of the consent form if you would like to continue now and read over the full document later or save a copy for your records. Alternatively, if you would like to take some time to think about things, I would also be happy to schedule a follow-up call with you later. So would you like to read it now, continue, or get back to us?\n[When done]\nDo you have any questions or anything you want me to know?\n[Answer their questions or move on if not]\nYou now have three options. You can decide to participate, decide not to participate, or you can take more time to make this decision.\nIf I have answered your questions, and you feel you understand the information in the consent form please tap “Continue” and then select “Yes, I am ready to say”yes” or “no” to participating in this study”.\n[If not ready]\nThat’s understandable and I’m glad you’re going to take more time. You should feel free to discuss the consent with anyone if you feel it will benefit you. It’s very important for you to be fully informed and not feel pressured before you consent.\nYou can go ahead and download the consent form by tapping the link on the screen that reads “Click here”. After you have read and considered them, please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have more questions. We can schedule a time window in the next few days for someone from our team to call back and discuss if you still want to participate after you have had time to review the consent form. Does that work for you?\n[If no]\nThat’s okay, we very much appreciate your time and interest in this study. Have a great day!\n[Answer any remaining questions and complete the telephone visit. No payment given]\n[If need more time to think about it]\nThat’s fine, you can text this number (608-571-3810) if you have any additional questions or if you make a decision. Otherwise, I will reach out to you in about one-week to check-in on how the decision making process is going and answer any additional questions that you might have.\n[Pick a time window to call, Answer any remaining questions and complete the telephone visit. Then put the follow up call on the star_psych@wisc.edu google calendar. No payment given]\n[If yes]\nOkay, great. Please type your full legal name into the space provided. This will function as your electronic signature. Once you are done, please pause and let me know.\n[Pause]\nConsent Qualtrics to Onboarding Qualtrics Transition - Aurora\nI am now going to connect you with a member of the STAR team who will help you set up your STAR account and walk you through the onboarding process.\nBefore I connect you with the STAR study team member, do you have any additional questions for me?\n[answer questions]\nAlright great! From this point forward, I and the rest of the Advocate Aurora staff will no longer be involved in your participation. We will never receive any data about you or your participation from the STAR team. If you have any questions or concerns about your participation from this point on, you should direct them to the STAR team. Please stay on the line while I connect you.\n[Connect with STAR Staff]\n[Bianca and RA say hello, Bianca introduces the participant to RA, Bianca says goodbye]\nIn the next/this form, you’ll be asked to provide some contact information and information about your background. On the first page you’ll provide your phone number, phone plan provider, and billing zip code. Then, you will be asked to provide an email you would like to use for the STAR app. Next, you’ll be asked to provide a mailing address that we will use to send you the payment debit card, and a W-9 form.\nThe W-9 form will come with instructions on how to complete it and a pre addressed envelope. We will not be able to send you your first monthly payment until it is returned, so it is crucial you get this back to us. How you do so is up to your discretion–you can either mail it or take a clear picture and send this to our hotline phone number, which we will provide after the call. If you choose to send an image, we can call over the phone to get your SSN.\nWe will mostly communicate with you through the study app, but we occasionally use your email address to get in touch with you. Then the final screen page of questions will ask you to select when you started your medication assisted treatment, as well as your race/ethnicity and date of birth.\nWhen you are ready, please tap continue to be taken to the next survey form and let me know when you have entered your date of birth.\nOnboarding Survey Link:\nhttps://uwmadison.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0jLkHPzJeVXI0IK\nGreat! Now we will get the app downloaded on your phone and set up your study account. If you are not currently on WIFI, this app download will use your cellular data. Will that be okay?\nGreat! Please tap continue, and the download should start automatically. The app will guide you through set up. You should agree to the permissions the app or your phone asks of you as it is setting up.\nWhen the app is downloaded, please let me know what you see on the screen\nhttps://star.achess.wisc.edu/apps/android/latest.apk\n[If participant does not see STAR homepage, troubleshoot]\nhat’s ok, sometimes participants have trouble loading the download. [Ask questions to determine what/where the issue is]\n[If it worked, they should see STAR homepage (“Welcome to STAR”, “Create your Account”)]\nGreat! Once the app is open, please tell me what you see.\nCan you confirm that you see the STAR landing page/ text that reads “Create your account”?\n[pause]\nOnce you type in the site id (1202), you’ll see a brief introduction. On the next page, you will see a form to Create an Account. This form asks for you to provide your First and Last name, your email and to create a unique screen name. You are going to want to pick a username that does not contain your name, as this is the name that others using the app will see when interacting with you on discussion boards or through direct messages. It can be a nickname or something random that comes to mind. You’ll also need to create a password at least 8 characters long.\nOnce you’ve created your account, you should receive several access requests. Please tap allow for this and the other four requests for accesses you receive. This access will allow the STAR app to collect the data we are asking of you as part of your participation. If you want, I can walk you through how each permission will be used by the STAR app to collect data.\n[Only read if participant wants to be walked through some/all permissions]\nAllow STAR to access your location\n\nThis permission will allow STAR to collect your GPS information and collect data for the visited locations survey\nAllow STAR to access your contacts\n\nThis permission allows us to create the social contacts survey and allow you to add contacts to the friends and family section of the star app\nAllow STAR to make or manage phone calls\n\nThis permission will allow you to dial study staff from the app and dial contacts you add to the friends and family section of the app\nAllow STAR to send and view SMS\n\nThis permission will allow us to gather data on you text message logs. Like I said earlier we will never be able to the content of any pictures you send or receive, and we will remove any personal identifiers from your text logs while we do our data analysis\n\nStop Optimizing Battery usage – Please tap Allow\n\nDo you have any questions about the access STAR will have to your device?\n[Pause]\nToday, the STAR app will ask you to complete the daily update. Please try to take the daily update after this call. Tomorrow and every day after, you will be asked to complete the daily update.\nOn the third day of your participation, and then once a month when you are on study, you’ll be prompted to complete the monthly update.\nAny questions?\n\n\n32.2.5 App Guidelines Information\nI want to take some time to tell you a bit about the STAR user guidelines. These guidelines were designed to make sure our participants and staff are protected and are treated professionally and with respect.\nBriefly, our guidelines are…\nTo always use respectful language on app discussion boards or in communication with study staff,\nTo communicate with staff and other STAR participants as you would in a professional work setting,\nAnd to avoid sharing personal or private information on the public discussion boards.\nAny questions about these guidelines?\nAll in-app messages, posts, and phone calls with staff are subject to review by the STAR team, and staff will remove any discussion post, comment, or individual member who does not follow these guidelines. You can find more information about the app guidelines and the review process for violating app guidelines in the Study Information tab in the STAR App.\n\n\n32.2.6 Final Steps\nThe final step of enrolling in the study will be to watch tutorial videos that describe the app’s recovery resources and explain how to complete the different study tasks. You can find these video tutorials in a text message I will send to you shortly after we complete this phone call.\nCompleting these video tutorials will take about 35 minutes [3] and you will be compensated $20 for your time.\n(Training Video Link: https://uwmadison.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_89fOXmASpmTIFEy)\nIf you experience any issues either with the video tutorials or completing any of the study tasks, please do not hesitate to email or call us.\nWe’ll want to call you in one week to see how everything is going with your participation. This will be a very brief call, only about 5 minutes and you’ll receive $10 compensation for its completion.\nSo, one week from now will put us at {insert date that is one-week from onboarding session}. Does that sound like it will work for you?\nAnd would you like to keep the same time or select a new one?\n[If no, pick another day either before or after 7 days]\n[If yes]\nAnd would you like to keep the same time or select a new one?\n[Allow participant to pick a time]\nGreat! The day before the one-week check-in, we’ll send you a quick email to remind you of the call.\nTo make sure this study can be a resource to as many people as possible, we ask all our participants where they heard about us and some basic information about their recovery process.\nHow did you find out about the study?\nHow has the recovery process been for you? How many times have you tried to be abstinent in your recovery?\nSo that is all I have for you today. Do you have any final questions or concerns?\n\n\n32.2.7 Thank Participants and End Visit\nWonderful! Well I want to thank you for your cooperation and patience in completing today’s consent and onboarding visit. It’s because of the commitment of people like you that we are able to do what we do and hopefully help others, and we appreciate you signing on to participate in our study. As a quick reminder, I’m going to give you a call [describe next session date/ time]. Otherwise, I hope you have a wonderful day!\nThank you!"

Reschedule if needed.]\n\n\n33.3.2 Introduction\nHi my name is [name] and I’m calling from the University of Wisconsin-Madison about the STAR study. Is now still a good time for you to talk?\nGreat! First, I’m going to tell you more about today’s session. I’ll be talking about our research study and then, if you are eligible and interested, we can enroll you today. The entire process should take about 30 minutes, and if you have any questions at any point, feel free to interrupt me.\n\n\n33.3.3 Description of the study\nThis is a 12-month study for people who are in recovery from opioids. It will involve using an Android smartphone app that was designed to help people in recovery, but it is not a treatment study, which means we will not be providing any treatment.\nPeople in the study will do tasks using the app. These will include filling out short daily surveys, a longer survey once a month, and sharing smartphone data.\nPeople who are part of this study need to keep their phone bill paid, and need to be consistent about keeping their phone charged.\nThis study will ask people about their experiences with drugs, so it is important that those who take part feel comfortable honestly answering questions about their use of opioids and other drugs.\nAll the information the study collects will be kept entirely anonymous and stored on the University’s secure servers, accessible ONLY to members of the study team.\nA lot of participants ask us, “if I report a lapse, how do I know law enforcement, CPS, or my treatment provider won’t find out?” Well, to prevent that, we’ve obtained a Certificate of Confidentiality, which means we are protected by the National Institute of Health from being forced to share study information with anyone outside the study team”.\nPeople who participate will be paid for completing daily and monthly study tasks. People who complete all the study tasks will receive about $70 a month, and we will also pay $50 a month to help people cover their monthly phone bill.\nParticipants will also get paid for the phone calls they have with STAR study staff a total of three times during the study. This session counts as the first phone call.\nSo based on what I have shared, are you interested in hearing more about participating in the study?\n[If yes, continue] [If no, thank and disconnect. No payment]\n\n\n33.3.4 Confirm phone OS- UW only\nWonderful! So before we continue further, I’d just like to just verify that you do have an Android phone and that you have that phone available to you now?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf No\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, our app only works on Android phones, which means I will not be able to enroll you at this time. I apologize for the inconvenience but greatly appreciate your interest in our study and hope you have a wonderful day.\n[no payment given]\nMark Visit on google calendar as “ineligible - iPhone”\n\n\n\n[If yes]\nOk great! In that case you are able to sign up for the study if you wish and we can go ahead and continue.\n\n\n33.3.5 Consent\nIn this part of the visit, I am going to tell you a little bit more about the study and then give you the chance to formally agree to join it.\nI’m going to send you a link to an online consent form. Sometimes it takes a while to come through so don’t worry if you don’t see it for a few minutes. You won’t need it until a little later, and if you have already received it, I’m going to ask that you hold off on opening it for now.\n[Switch to google voice and send the text message]\n\nNow I am going to tell you about the study goals and about the risks, benefits, and protections associated with being a participant in the study.\nSo - In this study, we will be collecting data from people who are in recovery from opioids because we want to identify the feelings, events, and behavior patterns that can lead to using opioids and other drugs.\nA lot of people in recovery have “slips,” where they use opioids but are still committed to recovery. These slips are sometimes called “relapses,” “episodes,” or “lapses.” And while slips may seem to come out of nowhere and take people by surprise, research has found evidence of warning signs like really stressful events, big changes to life circumstances, changes in moods, or being around friends or places that remind people of their past use.\nSo- the goal of the STAR study is to try to find new warning signs. We are looking for warning signs in two different kinds of information.\nFirst, we are looking for warning signs in information that people provide about their own experiences – so these are things like people’s moods, experiences of stress, urges to use, and how much people want to avoid using. This type of information will come from daily and monthly surveys that participants fill out.\nSecond, we are looking for warning signs in information that people do not need to tell us about, and that people might not even know about themselves. For example, people’s recent messages or where they go could contain a warning sign. People’s routines and patterns or changes to their routines and patterns could also contain warning signs. We gather this type of information from smartphone data including phone call logs, texts, and location.\nSo far, I have given examples of times when people are at greater risk of using opioids, but in this study, we are also looking for positive signs. People tend to do better in recovery when they are happy, have meaningful contact with other people, and when they have healthy habits and routines.\nFor this study to predict future opioid slips, we will need information about when slips have happened. This means that participants in this study will be asked every day if they have used opioids; and when they used the opioids.\nSo that is the main purpose of the study. Do you have any questions?\n[Answer questions until they have none]\nNow I’m going to describe what people are asked to do as participants in our study.\n- Participants download the STAR app onto their phone and have to keep that phone paid for and charged.\n- Every day they fill out a short survey that asks how they are doing.\n- Once a month, they fill out a longer survey that asks about their thoughts and experiences in the last month.\n\n\n33.3.6 App Data\nI’d also like to tell you more about what we’ll be doing with the smartphone data that people share with us. After I tell you about each item I’ll pause and ask if you have any questions.\nPeople will be asked to give the app permission to access their phone data, text messages, and their location data.\nFor phone data, our computer will be able to see the numbers of people you call or message frequently, and the name you have given them in your Contacts, if any. For example, we might see “this participant texted or spoke with 608-555-1234 four times over the last month. This person is saved in their contacts as Joe Smith”. We will use this information only to ask you generic questions about whether talking to this person is harmful or helpful to your recovery.\nDo you have any questions about how we access your phone data? [Pause and answer questions]\nFor text messages, our computer is able to read only the text of SMS messages you have sent or received. The computer cannot see any images you might send in texts, or any messages sent using other apps like Snapchat or Facebook. The study team CAN NOT see your actual texts in real time; and we CAN NOT “read your messages”. Near the end of the study, our computer will sort through the words in the messages to tell us general things about people’s messages. For example, the computer might tell us: “people in this study used the word ‘stressed’ in their texts much more often before they had a slip”… or… “this person used the word ‘happy’ more often when talking to a person they told us was helpful to their recovery”\nDo you have any questions about how we access your text messages? [Pause and answer questions]\nFor location data, our computer will be able to look through the GPS points recorded by your phone and use those to identify places you have spent time at. For example, the computer might tell us: “this person has visited 101 Main Street two times in the last month”. We will use this information only to ask you generic questions about whether visiting this location is helpful or harmful to your recovery. We CAN NOT “see where you are” in real-time and won’t know ANYTHING about these places other than what you choose to tell us.\nDo you have any questions about how we access your location data? [Pause and answer questions]\nWe know this is sensitive data and we want to be sure people understand and are comfortable with how we use it. Do you have ANY other questions on any of this data we’ll ask you to share? [Pause and answer questions]\nI also want to reassure you that you will be able to delete any phone logs or SMS messages that you don’t want us to see, and you will be able to turn off your location sharing if you don’t want us to see where you go for a period of time.\nAgain, I’d like to remind you that participation in the STAR study is totally voluntary. The study lasts up to one year, but you can stop being part of the study at any time. To remain enrolled, people have to complete most tasks, meaning all monthly updates and at least 6 daily updates per week, and share their phone, text message, and location data. If someone is not able to keep up with tasks or does not want to share their data anymore, we will talk with them and may decide to stop their participation early.\nIt is also important that you know that any use of opioids or other drugs has NO effect on your participation. You can continue to participate regardless of when or how many times you might use opioids or other drugs. It is ONLY important that you HONESTLY report any opioid or drug use when asked about it in the surveys.\n\n\n33.3.7 Risks/Benefits\nNext we’ll go over study risks and benefits. There are no major risks related to participation in this study. If you decide to participate, the main risk is that someone might see your information who should not.\nFor this reason, we are VERY careful and have created safeguards regarding how your data is stored and accessed. Protecting your data and privacy is our top priority, and we are overseen by a group at the University of Wisconsin-Madison that exists to protect and help research subjects. With their guidance, we follow careful protocols for storing, using, and sharing any information that could be used to find out who participants are.\nHere are some examples of how we will protect your information and reduce the risk that someone might see it:\n\nWe store your contact information like your name and address in a locked location that is separate from the study data.\n\nWe label study data with an anonymous study id number.\n\nWhen we share results and data with other researchers, we will not share information that could be used to find out who participants are, like their location data.\n\nWe will only ever give group summaries of demographic information, like people’s age, gender, and race or ethnicity.\n\nThere are no direct benefits of taking part in this study. The STAR app that participants use was designed to help people in recovery and might help you, but we are not treatment providers, and this study is not a treatment. Of course, our team does hope that in the future, what we learn in this study will be used to improve treatments for other people in recovery.\nWe will compensate people who participate in the study for as long as they choose to do so. If you decide to enroll, you will earn:\n+ $20 for the first phone visit (that’s this visit)\n+ $10 for a phone call in a week to check in about the study\n+ $10 for a phone call at the very end of the study\nThere will be only 3 calls total over the entire 12-month course of the study. This call counts as one of those three calls. To be clear, we will NOT be calling or checking-in on you regularly aside from the surveys you complete in-app.\nFor every task you complete in the app you will earn payments, and you can also earn bonuses for meeting target goals, with payments up to about $70 per month.\nAgain, we will also pay you an additional $50 a month to help cover the cost of your monthly phone bill.\nCompensation will be provided via a payment debit card that we will mail to you after successful download of the STAR app. Once compensated for the completion of your initial calls and training, you will receive payment on your designated date once a month, either on the 15th or the 30th. We will be able to tell you which date you will be paid during the one-week check-in call.\nAll of that said, this study was not designed to make money for the research team or anyone else. If you participate in the study and if the research team develops products from this study, you will not receive any profits. It is also important to let you know that one member of the STAR research team partially owns the company that makes the study app, and as such they may financially benefit from this research study.\nBased on what I have shared, what questions do you have for me? [Pause and answer questions]\nThe information I just gave you about the study goals and the risks, benefits, and protections are things that we make sure everyone who is thinking about joining the study hears and understands.\nThe next step of the process is to make a formal decision about whether you want to be part of the study. In a minute, I’ll have you click on that link I sent you, which will show you a Consent Form with all the information I just reviewed stated in more technical language. Then you’ll be asked if you are ready to decide if you want to participate. If you do, you’ll be asked a few questions, and these will take information that we need to pay you and help make sure our study includes different types of people.\nThen, finally, you’ll download the app and set up an account.\n\n\n33.3.8 Participant opens consent link & gives consent\nNow is the time to open that link that I texted you. You should see a document that says “Consent Form” at the top. You can take as much time as you like to read it over and let me know when you are done. I will sit quietly here in case you have any questions.\nYou’ll also be able to download a copy of the consent form if you would like to continue now and read over the full document later, or save a copy for your records.\nAlternatively, if you would like to take some time to think about things, I would also be happy to schedule a follow-up call with you later.\nSo would you like to read it now, continue right away, or read it later and get back to us?\n[If they read it right away, wait till they are done]\nDo you have any questions or anything you want me to know?\n[Answer their questions or move on if not]\nYou now have three options. You can decide to participate, decide not to participate, or you can take more time to make this decision.\nIf I have answered your questions, and you feel you understand the information in the consent form please tap “Continue” and then select “Yes, I am ready to say”yes” or “no” to participating in this study”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf not ready to review consent or need more time to think about it before consenting\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s understandable and I’m glad you’re going to take more time. You should feel free to discuss the consent with anyone if you feel it will benefit you. It’s very important for you to be fully informed and not feel pressured before you consent.\nYou can go ahead and download the consent form by tapping the link on the screen that reads “Click here”. After you have read and considered them, please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have more questions or have made a decision. We can schedule a time window in the next few days for someone from our team to call back and discuss if you still want to participate after you have had time to review the consent form. Does that work for you?\n[Pick a time window to call, Answer any remaining questions and complete the telephone visit. Then put the follow up call on the star_psych@wisc.edu google calendar. No payment given]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf “No” - do not want to consent\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s okay, we very much appreciate your time and interest in this study. Have a great day!\n[Answer any remaining questions and complete the telephone visit. No payment given]\n\n\n\n[If ready to consent “Yes”]\nOkay, great. Please type your full legal name into the space provided. This will function as your electronic signature. Once you are done, please pause and let me know.\n[Pause]\nIn the next form, you’ll be asked to provide some contact information and information about your background. On the first page you’ll provide your phone number and phone plan provider. Then, you will be asked to provide an email you would like to use for the STAR app. Next, you’ll be asked to provide a mailing address that we will use to send you the payment debit card, and a W-9 form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf they skip through the the consent form, PICK UP HERE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe W-9 form that we send you along with the payment card will come with instructions on how to complete it, and a pre addressed envelope for you to mail it back to us. We will not be able to send you your first monthly payment until it is returned, so it is crucial you get this back to us. You can either mail it back to us, or take a clear picture and send this to our hotline phone number, which we will provide after the call. If you choose to send an image, we can call over the phone to get your SSN.\nWe will mostly communicate with you through the study app, but we occasionally use your email address to get in touch with you. Then the final screen page of questions will ask you to select when you started your medication assisted treatment, as well as your race/ethnicity and date of birth.\nWhen you are ready, please tap continue to be taken to the next survey form and let me know when you have entered your date of birth.\nGreat! Now we will get the app downloaded on your phone and set up your study account. If you are not currently on WIFI, this app download will use your cellular data. Will that be okay?\n\n\n33.3.9 App Download\nGreat! Please tap continue, and the download should start automatically. The app will guide you through set up. You should agree to the permissions the app or your phone asks of you as it is setting up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the download does not start\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s ok, sometimes participants have trouble loading the download. [Ask questions to determine what/where the issue is]*\n[You can also send this link via text: https://star.achess.wisc.edu/apps/android/latest.apk ]\n\n\n\n[If participant does not see STAR homepage, troubleshoot]\n[If it worked, they should see STAR homepage (“Welcome to STAR”, “Create your Account”)]\nGreat! Once the app is downloaded, please let me know what you see on the screen.\n[Wait for confirmation]\nAnd you can see the text that reads “Create your account”?\n[pause]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf they skip through the the app download, PICK UP HERE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you type in the site id (1202), you’ll see a brief introduction. On the next page, you will see a form to Create an Account. This form asks for you to provide your First and Last name, your email and to create a unique screen name. You are going to want to pick a username that does not contain your name, as this is the name that others using the app will see when interacting with you on discussion boards or through direct messages. It can be a nickname or something random that comes to mind. You’ll also need to create a password at least 8 characters long.\nOnce you’ve created your account, you should receive several access requests. Please tap allow for all the permission access requests you receive. This access will allow the STAR app to collect the data we are asking of you as part of your participation. If you want, I can walk you through how each permission will be used by the STAR app to collect data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to read if participant wants to be walked through some/all permissions\n\n\n\n\n\nAllow STAR to access your location\n\nThis permission will allow STAR to collect your GPS information and collect data for the visited locations survey\nAllow STAR to access your contacts\n\nThis permission allows us to create the social contacts survey and allow you to add contacts to the friends and family section of the star app\nAllow STAR to make or manage phone calls\n\nThis permission will allow you to dial study staff from the app and dial contacts you add to the friends and family section of the app\nAllow STAR to send and view SMS\n\nThis permission will allow us to gather data on you text message logs. Like I said earlier we will never be able to the content of any pictures you send or receive, and we will remove any personal identifiers from your text logs while we do our data analysis\nStop Optimizing Battery usage – Please tap Allow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf they skip through the creating an account, PICK UP HERE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you have any other questions about the access STAR will have to your device? [Pause and answer questions]\nToday, the STAR app will ask you to complete your first DAILY update. Please try to take the daily update soon after this call. You will be asked to complete another daily update every day of your participation.\nOn the THIRD day of your participation, and then once a month when you are on study, you’ll be prompted to complete the MONTHLY update.\nDo you have any questions on that?\n\n\n33.3.10 App Guidelines\nNow I want to take some time to tell you a bit about the STAR user guidelines. These guidelines were designed to make sure our participants and staff are protected and are treated professionally and with respect.\nBriefly, our guidelines are…\nTo always use respectful language on app discussion boards or in communication with study staff,\nTo communicate with staff and other STAR participants as you would in a professional work setting,\nAnd to avoid sharing personal or private information on the public discussion boards.\nAny questions about these guidelines?\nAll in-app messages, posts, and phone calls with staff are subject to review by the STAR team, and staff will remove any discussion post, comment, or individual member who does not follow these guidelines. You can find more information about the app guidelines and the review process for violating app guidelines in the Study Information tab in the STAR App.\n\n\n33.3.11 Final Steps\nThe final step of enrolling in the study will be to watch tutorial videos that describe the app’s recovery resources and explain how to complete the different study tasks. You can find these video tutorials in a text message I will send to you shortly after we complete this phone call.\nCompleting these video tutorials will take about 35 minutes for four videos and you will be compensated $20 for your time.\nIf you experience any issues either with the video tutorials or completing any of the study tasks, please do not hesitate to email or call us.\nWe’ll want to call you in one week to see how everything is going with your participation. This will be a very brief call, only about 5 minutes, and you’ll receive $10 compensation for its completion.\nSo, one week from now will put us at {insert date/time that is one-week from onboarding session}. Does that sound like it will work for you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf no, pick another day either just before or after 7 days\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd would you like to keep the same time or select a new one?\n[Allow participant to pick a time]\n\n\n\nGreat! The day before the one-week check-in, we’ll send you a quick text to remind you of the call.\nSo that is all I have for you today. Do you have any final questions or concerns? [Answer any questions]\nWonderful! Well I want to thank you for your cooperation and patience in completing today’s consent and onboarding visit. It’s because of the commitment of people like you that we are able to do what we do and hopefully help others, and we appreciate you signing on to participate in our study. As a quick reminder, I’m going to give you a call [describe next session date/ time] but you can message us if you have any questions before then. I hope you have a wonderful day!\nThank you!"

Is there a time that would work for you tomorrow or in the next couple of days? This call should take about 10-15 minutes. [Find a time that work] Thank you, we’ll call you at that time instead. Goodbye! [Be sure to add the new visit to the calendar and mark this visit “Rescheduled”]\n\n\n\n{If Yes}\nGreat! I’m calling to check on how the study is going, and how the STAR app is working for you. Now as you may remember at the end of your onboarding session, I sent you a link with several video tutorials that would explain key aspects of the STAR app in detail. Were you able to watch through all of the video tutorials?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf No\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s alright. Can I ask why you did not complete the video tutorials?\nPossible Reasons & responses\n\nI lost the link to the videos\n\nThat’s ok! Would you like me to send you a new link to the video tutorials at the end of this call? You can still complete the tutorials in the next week to earn an additional $20 added to your first bonus payment\n\n\nI did not get a chance to watch them/I forgot\n\nThat’s ok! The reason we ask you to watch the video tutorials is because they explain important details about how to set up and use the STAR app. Would you like me to send you a new link to the video tutorials at the end of this call? You can still complete the tutorials in the next week to earn an additional $20 added to your first bonus payment\n\nI don’t feel like watching them\n\nThat’s ok! The reason we ask you to watch the video tutorials is because they explain important details about how to set up and use the STAR app but as long as you are completing the study tasks, you can still participate in this study. However, you will be missing out on a potential $20 bonus you would have received if you watched the video tutorials\n\n\n\n\n\n{if yes, refer to the Rscript and see if they had any questions}\nGreat! Thank you for watching the STAR video tutorials. It looks like you [DID/DID NOT] have any questions when you watched them. [ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS, IF ANY ]\nDo you have any additional questions about the training materials? [ANSWER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS]\nSo for watching all of the video tutorials that means that you will receive an additional $20 added to your first study bonus payment.\nNow I wanted to check in and ask how it is going as far as completing each of the study tasks, starting with the monthly update. Were you able to complete the monthly update?\n(Pause for response)\nAnd how was the monthly update? Did you have any issues?\n(Pause for response)\nGreat and how about the daily updates? Any issues with completing the daily update surveys?\n(Pause for response)\nDo you feel like you are able to make the daily update a part of you daily routine?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf No\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat aspects of the daily study tasks do you feel you are having the most trouble with?\n[Troubleshoot and offer advice if possible. For example, if they say they are having trouble remembering to do the tasks, you might say:]\nDo you have any other daily habits that you could use to remind you to do your study tasks? (for example, if they always eat breakfast at the same time encourage them to do the tasks before or after breakfast;)\n\n\n\nNext I’d like to review the phone data you’re sharing with us. [IF NO ISSUES READ:] It looks like we’re getting all the data we need from your phone, so you’re all set there.\nIF THERE ARE ISSUES WITH THE DATA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf No or very little GPS\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately it looks like we’re not getting any GPS from your phone. I can either walk you through making sure that location sharing is enabled, or I can send you instructions by text after our call?  [Walk them through checking their settings or text this to them afterwards]\n\nClick the STAR menu\nClick Settings\nClick Research Study Settings\nClick Change Settings\nClick Yes on the warning that comes up. This will open you’re phones settings for the STAR App.\nClick Permissions to review what permissions you’ve granted the STAR App. Make sure that “Location permission” is enabled all the time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf No SMS AND No Voice\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also looks like we aren’t getting any SMS or Voice logs from your phone. However, this could be because you haven’t made any voice calls or sent any SMS, rather than an issue with permissions. If you think you have been making calls or texts, you might want to check those permissions as well.\n\n\n\nFinally, have you noticed any change in your battery life since download the app? For example, have you noticed it dying more quickly or frequently than usual?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Yes\n\n\n\n\n\nOk. It is normal for certain types of cell phones to be more affected by the STARs app location data sharing, especially if you do not use your phone fairly often throughout the day. I can walk you through how to turn on battery optimization for the STAR app, which should improve the issue.\n{Explain how to turn on battery optimization}\n1. Go to Settings\n2. Tap “Apps”\n3. Tap “STAR”\n4. Tap “Battery”\n5. Tap “Optimize battery usage”\n6. Scroll down to STAR and tap the toggle to the On position (the circle should be on the right and the toggle bar should go from gray to blue)\n\n\n\n{If No}\nGreat! Well, if it has not impacted your battery life up to this point, it is unlikely that it will negatively impact battery life during the rest of your time on the study. If at any point you start to suspect that your battery life is changing significantly, please reach out to study staff.\nNow I just want to walk you through what you can expect in the coming weeks and months of your participation in the STAR study. First, you will be receiving your first study payment in the next couple of weeks. This payment will be loaded on the reloadable debit card we sent you. Your first study payment will include payment for the onboarding session, today’s call, and watching the star video tutorials (if they completed them).\nPlease do not lose or throw away this card. Each month, the bonuses you have earned for completing your study tasks and sharing data the previous month will be added to that card. You will receive your monthly study payments on the {15th/30th SPECIFY BASED ON THE R SCRIPT} of each month. If that payment date falls on a weekend or bank holiday, you would instead receive payment the following business day.\nIf you do lose or misplace the card, please let us know as soon as possible and we will give you the number for US Bank so they can send you a replacement card\nAny questions about your study payment?\nAlso, I want to let you know that your next monthly updates will be asking you about the people you talk to (either by text or by phone call) and places you visit over the course of any given month. You will be asked a few questions about each person or place designed to help us understand your relationship to that person or place. Once you have been asked about a person or place, you will not be asked about them again. This means that there may be some months where you are asked about many people or places, and some months where you are asked about very few or no new people or places. As with all the data in this study, any information you provide about the people and places you come into contact with will be kept confidential.\nAny questions?\nAdditionally, once every few months your monthly update will contain a set of questions that will ask you to report on your experiences as a study participant. These questions are designed to help us understand how people feel about participating in the study and completing the study tasks. Your responses to these questions will be kept confidential and will not affect your study participation in any way.\nAny questions?\nFinally, I want to remind you that if you ever have any questions about your participation in the study, the STAR app, or the study itself, you can reach out to us by phone or by email. If we determine that it would be appropriate to set up an appointment to troubleshoot through the issue, you would be compensated for the time you spent.\nAny questions?\nOk then! Well {Insert participant name} I want to thank you for your time today and thank you again for your kindness in volunteering with your study participation."

I just want to take a few minutes reminding you of the goals of this study, and how your participation has contributed to this goal. I will then help you remove the app from your phone or turn off data sharing if you would like to continue using the app. Feel free to interrupt me at any time if you have questions.\nRestate Goals of Study As you might remember from the first visit, the major goal of this study is to use the data you and other participants provided to develop a system that can predict the day-to-day chance that an individual with experience an opioid or other drug lapse.\nWe hope that the system we build, based on data from participants like you, will improve the treatment landscape for individuals in recovery.\nAny questions?\nThank You Letter \nOn behalf of the research team, I’d like to send you a thank you letter for your participation. This letter will also have a website link that you can visit to access additional resources near you.\nRemove Star App/Change Permissions\nNow that you are done with the study, you may delete the Star app from your phone. Although you are not required to delete the star app from your phone, after the study is over, the app will no longer be updated and, eventually, may no longer be supported by your phone’s operating system. If you choose to keep the app for the time being, I will help you change your research study settings to stop sharing your sensitive data (location, phone logs, and text messages) with us. Would you like to remove the star app or keep it for now?\nIf Participant Chooses to Remove App\nTo delete the STAR app, press and hold down on the app’s icon until the app shortcut’s popup shows up. You’ll either see an “i” button or see App Info; tap it. Next, tap Uninstall.\nIf Participant Chooses Keep App\nWill fill this in once we get confirmation that participants will be able to keep the app beyond study end date&gt; Alright great! I’m going to walk you through how to turn off data sharing so that we are no longer collecting your personal information. First, please open the Star App. Next, tap the Settings button. In Settings, tap Research Study Settings, next tap “Change Settings”. You should get a message from Star notifying you that changing these settings will reduce your next bonus by $15, please tap “Yes”\nYou should be taken to the App info page for Star in your phone settings. In app info, please tap the “Permissions” button. Please let me know when you are on this page.\nLet me know what you see on this page\nIn App permissions, you should see several toggle switches. In order to turn off data sharing, To change a permission setting, tap it, then choose Allow or Deny.\nA permission is turned off when the circle in the toggle is on the left-hand side. Please let me know when all of the App Permissions are turned off.\nGreat!\nDo you have any additional questions about the study?\nAccess Final Results\nBefore you go, I want to give you some information about where you will be able to eventually find the results from this study. Final results may take up to 5 years to be published. When they are published, you can find them at the link provided in the thank you letter we (sent/will send you?) &lt; https://reporter.nih.gov/search/JbRgAtchAUKHOoW2X1vObQ/projects/map/project-details/9980350. All results will be grouped together; therefore, individual results are not available. Your participation, including your name and answers, will remain absolutely confidential, even if the report is published.\nDo you have any questions for me before you leave?\nThank Participant/End Session\nGreat! On behalf of everyone at the UW Addiction Research Center I want thank you so much for participating. We couldn’t do this type of research without volunteers like you."

Your first payment of $20 has been added to the card and will be available immediately after activation.\nKeep this card safe, as all future payments will be loaded on this card. 2. Please fill in the top half of the enclosed W-9 form (highlighted fields) and mail back to us using the enclosed self-addressed, stamped envelope.\nIf you prefer, you can fill out the form EXCEPT leave the social security number (SSN) field blank, and text or email us a photo of the completed form. Then, call us at 608-262-1362 to give us your SSN securely. It is safest to send social security numbers by mail or phone call, not by text or email.\nYou must return this W-9 form before we are able to issue any further payments.\nWe are also including some flyers about this project, if you know others who might be interested.\nIf you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at star@psych.wisc.edu or 608-262-1362.\nSincerely,\nSTAR Study\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison"

    "title": "42  Payment Frequently Asked Questions",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Q: When will I receive payment?\nA: Participants will receive payment on their designated date once a month, on either the 15th or 30th as determined by their start date. Payments will always be issued by 5 PM Central Time. If a payment date falls on a weekend or bank holiday, payments will instead by issued the following business day. If you are unsure about your payment date, please contact the STAR team directly.\nQ: Why are payments always issued by 5 PM Central Time?\nA: Payments are issued by 5 PM Central Time as our team calculates them manually. We begin the process at 6 AM day of, and then spend the next few hours manually reviewing each and every participant’s data to ensure they receive the maximum amount possible.\nQ: What happens when a payment date is on a weekend or holiday?\nA: Payments will instead be issued the following business day by 5 PM Central Time.\nQ: What do I do if my card is lost or stolen?\nA: Contact US Bank Card Services at 877-474-0010. They can freeze your card and provide a replacement. They also have representatives 24/7!\nQ: What if I never received my payment card?\nA: Contact our team with your address and we can provide a replacement. This does not apply if you have already received and activated a payment card from us in the past.\nQ: How much can I expect to earn?\nA: Participants may receive up to $120 a month and $1560 over the 12-month course of the study. The precise amount may vary due to the length of each month, for instance, one may be compensated less for February than for March. Specifically, one will earn: $1.25 per daily survey, $10 per monthly survey, and $50 a month towards the payment of cell service if phone log, SMS, and GPS data are shared. Participants will also earn $5 for each type of data shared and up to two $5 bonuses per month if at least 6 daily surveys are completed a week. This comes to about $70 for tasks and bonuses and $50 for the cell phone bill. Participants also receive compensation for the three calls they have with STAR Study Staff, being their initial onboarding session, the one-week follow-up, and a debrief at the end of the study. These are compensated at $20, $10, and $10, respectively.\nQ: What do I do with the W-9?\nA: Please mail us your completed W-9 using the instructions and pre-addressed envelope included in your welcome package, or take a clear photo and text it to our hotline number (608-571-3810). If you decide to take a photo, please give us a call so we can collect your SSN over the phone. Note that we will not be able to issues your monthly payments until we have received your W-9.\nQ: Why do I have to complete a W-9?\nA: Any earnings over $600 in one tax year must be reported to the IRS, per federal law. We will not be able to issue your monthly payments until your W-9 is received."

    "text": "45.2 *What is a trivial message?\nIt’s important to record any message that might affect: a) a participants’ data, b) a participant’s payment or participation, or c) our interactions with a participant.\nTrivial messages would be those that don’t affect our relationship with the participant, don’t affect their data, don’t affect their payment or participation. Think about it like: would knowing about this message change how you interact with this participant later?\nFor example:\n\nParticipant asks what their payment date is, or asks for the link to the screening survey to send to an interested friend. That is just an request for information - it does need a response, but does not need to be recorded in their thread.\nParticipant responds to monthly payment message with ‘Thank you, no questions’ - that does not need to be recorded and we also probably wouldn’t need to respond to them.\nParticipant responds to monthly payment message with “Why didn’t you tell me I missed surveys? This isn’t fair” - That probably needs to be recorded AND does need a response (but probably one from Ariela or Susan). It tells us that the participant is possibly belligerent and we might need to tread carefully around them in future communications.\nParticipant sent a DM out of the blue saying how much the study has helped them and how grateful they are - probably doesn’t NEED to be recorded, but I would probably do it anyway. It tells us that the participant is very nice and appreciative and I might use that information to forgive a missed survey or two. It would also warrant a warm response.\n\nThat’s another detail about participant communication that is hard to quantify: mostly we want our messages to be detached, factual, clinical. But sometimes participants express hardship or positive news that requires warm or sympathetic responses. Currently, only Ariela and Susan will send that type of message, but it’s worth you knowing about!"

Be sure to make appropriate edits where it says to insert a specific date, time, RA name, etc!\nFor more complicated issues, you will just tag Susan or Ariela when you post the issue in the participant’s thread, and they will tell you what response needs to be sent.\nWhen you have responded, make sure your response is summarized in the participant thread along with the issue.

Or participants may send a text message and then follow up with a DM. Again it’s VERY IMPORTANT that you verify whether a message has already been responded to or addressed by other means, before you reply, so always check the participant thread before replying."

    "text": "46.1 Read before Sending any Reminders\n\nSTAR staff will send consent/onboarding session reminders via text the day prior to visits. Staff can use the Google Voice helpline number (the uwmstarstudy@gmail.com account) for this.\nIt is VERY important that you verify the number in google voice belongs to the correct person!\n\nWhen you search by Subid, it’s best to copy and paste the subid from the calendar invite so you don’t transpose digits.\nMake sure the phone number is visible and you can see other texts in their thread! If you search subid 1000 and there’s no contact, Google Voice will let you send to 11000 and that’s not a real number, so the person does not get the text.\n\nIf the person is an older participant, they may not have a contact saved. Look them up using the enrollment database and get their number from there.\n\nPlease include the time in the participant’s Time Zone first, followed by Central time IF DIFFERENT. For example: 1pm Eastern time/ 12pm Central time.\nWhen you are sending reminders that aren’t for tomorrow - for example, if you are sending a Monday visit reminder, on a Friday - PLEASE be sure to change “tomorrow” to the actual day of the visit!\nSometimes, when a participant reschedules an onboarding visit, their phone number doesn’t copy to the new google calendar event. If you need to send a reminder but there’s no phone number, go into the star_psych outlook account and search by name for the original booking, which will have the number.\n\n\n46.1.1 How to get time zones:\n\n46.1.1.1 To get time zones for a Consent/Onboard session:\nCopy and paste the following code in the Console pane of RStudio; then hit enter to run:\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(here)\n\npath_lab_support &lt;- \"../lab_support\"\npath_data_admin &lt;- \"P:/studydata/risk2/data_admin/\"\n\nsource(here(\"functions\", \"fun_star.R\"))\nsource(here(path_lab_support, \"fun_gps.R\"))\n\npath_admin &lt;- \"P:/administration\"\ntoken_qualtrics &lt;-\n  read_csv(file.path(path_admin, \"credentials.csv\")) %&gt;%\n  filter(resource == \"qualtrics\") %&gt;%\n  pull(token)\n\nscreen &lt;- tidy_qualtrics(\"screening\", token_qualtrics,  display_progress = FALSE, raw=TRUE) %&gt;% select(eligible_first_name:LocationLongitude)\nClick on the “screen” dataframe at the top-right hand side and search by their phone number or email. There’s latitude/longitude columns that you can copy & paste into google (put a comma between them) and google will tell you the location zip code and you can use that to check the time zone: ie. 38.946106, -89.417999\n\n\n46.1.1.2 To verify the time zone of a current participant (1-week or final visit):\nCopy & paste the following code in the Console pane of RStudio (hit enter to run):\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(here)\n\npath_lab_support &lt;- \"../lab_support\"\npath_data_admin &lt;- \"P:/studydata/risk2/data_admin/\"\n\nsource(here(\"functions\", \"fun_star.R\"))\nsource(here(path_lab_support, \"fun_gps.R\"))\n\npath_admin &lt;- \"P:/administration\"\ntoken_qualtrics &lt;-\n  read_csv(file.path(path_admin, \"credentials.csv\")) %&gt;%\n  filter(resource == \"qualtrics\") %&gt;%\n  pull(token)\n  \nenroll &lt;- tidy_qualtrics(\"enroll\", token_qualtrics) #load enrolled\nThen click the “enroll” dataframe at the top-right hand side and search for the subid. You will see their city/state/zip which you can use to google their time zone."

Although academic labs are far more casual than corporate employers, there are still general levels of professionalism that are expected:\n\nBe on time for your shift and plan to stay till the end. If you need to leave early, communicate that to Susan at the START of your shift. Communicate about any absences, planned or unplanned, as promptly as possible.\nHold yourself to a high standard in the written material you produce - messages both to other RAs/staff and to participants should be proofread & clearly communicate what you’re asking or saying.\nBe prepared. This can mean, having everything ready for a session before it starts, or it can mean, having reviewed all the available information before asking for help, so we are better positioned to start helping you solve an issue.\nBe dependable. If you are assigned a task be sure to follow thorough without reminders. The most helpful thing you can do is become able to work independently and be relied on by your coworkers.\nBe engaged. Academia is an occupation where your passion really needs to shine through!\n\nIf you are having a bad day where it is hard to pay attention to detail, it may be better to call out sick than to try to do your tasks and be unable to complete them well. It’s far easier for someone to cover your entire workload from scratch, than it is to try to fix sloppy or half-finished tasks."

If you read any documentation that is unclear, confusing, etc, please let us know!\nYou should be proactive in reading and re-reading through our documentation, both to help you learn the ins and outs of our study and your tasks, and also to help you learn where to find the information you need to complete your tasks. Sometimes it feels easier to ask “hey, how do I do X again?” than to open the manual and bring up the instructions, but remember, we’re depending on you to be able to work independently.\nThat doesn’t mean you shouldn’t ask if something isn’t clear!

You are a representative of our lab and of the University of Wisconsin and are therefore expected to maintain the standards which for which the university is known.\nWritten messages must be proofread carefully, not only for correct content but for proper punctuation, spelling, formatting, etc. Even though minor typos do happen, they look bad and can make participants less likely to trust us with their sensitive data.\nEven if you are copying from a message template, errors in the template should be found and corrected prior to sending the messages. Let Susan know if you find errors in templates so they can be corrected at the source!\nIt is also critical that participants not receive confusing or mixed messages from us. Please verify that no other RA or staff member is currently in a message chain with a participant before adding a message about the same topic.\nSometimes, this can require some critical thinking. Say you have a participant show up on compliance check and the procedure says you should send a message about missing 8 recent daily surveys. You check their thread, and see that Ariela just messaged a participant the link to download the STAR app to their new phone. Is that a separate enough topic that you should still send the compliance message? No: a participant who just got a download link probably did not have the app for several days, and already knows that they missed these surveys. There is no need for a compliance message to remind them about missed surveys at this time."

Click the down arrow next to that, and hit Open Project. Browse to your repository and you will see a .rProj file that you can open. That opens your project and makes sure that all the scripts can find the right file paths.\nIf you don’t see a .rProj file in the repo, you may need to create one - Ask Susan for guidance!\n\n\n57.2.2 Run code chunks in Rmarkdown scripts\nClick on one of the icon on the top of the grey code chunk:\n* The grey arrow down pointing to a green bar: run all the code chunks above\n* The green triangle: run the code chunk below\nClick on the corresponding icon to execute the code chunks you want. You can find a more detailed list of what each symbol means by clicking the dropdown arrow next to the “Run” button on the top of the manual bar.\n\n\n57.2.3 Running code in the console\nYou can copy a line or chunk of code and paste it in the console pane (lower left-hand part of Rstudio) and hit enter to run it.\n\n\n57.2.4 To know if the code finished runnning\nIf there is a red stop sign on the right corner of the console/terminal section located on the bottom panel, the code is NOT done. The sign will disappear once the code is done. If you see a red error message showing up under the console section, take a screenshot of the error and consult Susan.\n\n\n57.2.5 View the data frame generated by the code\nIn the “environment” pane (on the upper right corner of R studio), you will find a list of data frame generated. Simply click on the name of the data you’d like to access and it will pop up, looking like a spreadsheet\n\n\n57.2.6 Update packages in R studio\nThere are two ways of updating the packages. 1. Using code Use the code here: “update.packages(ask = FALSE)” The code above will update all the outdated packages without asking permission for each one. 2. Click on package and update\n\n\n57.2.7 Uupdate R and R studio\n\nTo update R: click on “R” on the menu bar once R is opened&gt;&gt; Check for R Updates &gt;&gt; Type “yes” if you see the question “Do you want to visit CRAN now”? &gt;&gt; Download the most recent version of R.\nTo update R studio: This time open R studio and click “Help” on the menu bar on the top of the screen &gt;&gt; Check for Updates &gt;&gt; You will see a message asking you if you’d like to download the most recent version of R if there’s a new version."
