    "text": "1.1 Study Procedure Chronology\n\nRecruitment. Participants recruited (e.g., via VA, MAT clinic, craigslist, reddit, or Facebook ads)\n\nScreening. Participants fill out a screening survey; if eligible, they are directed to a Doodle poll to schedule an Onboarding/Consent call\nConsent and onboarding. Participants are walked though the study procedures and consent form. Once they give consent, they provide demographic information and are assigned a subID, and are walked through installing the app. They are instructed to watch a set of video tutorials to learn to use the STAR app. They are scheduled for a 1-week check in phone call. They are mailed a set of onboarding materials including a payment card.\nOne-week check-in. Enrolled participants meet with study staff after 1 week via video call to troubleshoot any technical issues and otherwise ensure that they have what they need to participate fully. Specifically ask if they have been recording their faces in the daily video check-ins / if that has been comfortable.\nMonthly payment. Every month participants will be issued a bonus in the form of a reload on a debit card. They will be sent a confirmation of this payment with a summary of the length of their participation, acknowledgement of their scheduled end date, a summary of their compliance over the month, and a statement of the bonus amount being issued.\nDebriefing. At the end of the study enrollment period, whether this is after one year or earlier (e.g., for participants to discontinue and who we are able to get in touch with) meet briefly with study staff for a debriefing session.\nDocumentation of participant issues & activities. Each participant has an admin thread in the proj-risk2-admin slack channel. Study activities and participant communication are recorded here. Additionally, There is a Web Log (WOG) where issues with participant data are recorded. There is also a Date Log where participant visit dates and changes in study status are documented."
