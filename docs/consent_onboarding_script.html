<p><em>Hi my name is [name] and I’m calling from the University of Wisconsin-Madison about the STAR study. Is now still a good time for you to talk?</em></p>
<p><em>Great! First, I’m going to tell you more about today’s session. I’ll be talking about our research study and then, if you are eligible and interested, we can enroll you today. The entire process should take about 30 minutes, and if you have any questions at any point, feel free to interrupt me.</em></p>

<h3 data-number="20.0.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="description-of-the-study"><span class="header-section-number">20.0.2</span> Description of the study</h3>
<p><em>This is a 12-month study for people who are in recovery from opioids. It will involve using an Android smartphone app that was designed to help people in recovery, but it is not a treatment study, which means we will not be providing any treatment.</em></p>
<p><em>People in the study will do tasks using the app. These will include filling out short daily surveys, a longer survey once a month, and sharing smartphone data.</em></p>
<p><em>People who are part of this study need to keep their phone bill paid and need to be consistent about keeping their phone charged.</em></p>
<p><em>This study will ask people about their experiences with drugs, so it is important that those who take part feel comfortable honestly answering questions about their use of opioids and other drugs.</em></p>
<p><em>All the information the study collects will be kept entirely anonymous and stored on the University’s secure servers, accessible only to members of the study team. A lot of participants ask us, “if I report a lapse, how do I know law enforcement, CPS, or my treatment provider won’t find out?” Well, to prevent this, we’ve obtained a Certificate of Confidentiality, which means we are protected by the National Institute of Health from being forced to share study information with anyone outside the study team”.</em></p>
<p><em>People who participate will be paid for completing daily and month study tasks. People who complete all the study tasks will receive about $70 a month, and we will also pay $50 a month to help people cover their monthly phone bill.</em></p>
<p><em>Participants will also get paid for the phone calls they have with STAR study staff a total of three times during the study. This session counts as one of the phone calls.</em></p>
<p><em>So based on what I have shared, are you interested in hearing more about participating in the study?</em></p>
<p><strong>[If yes, continue]</strong> <strong>[If no, thank and disconnect. No payment]</strong></p>

<p>UW:<a href="https://uwmadison.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6zzSu1ddmyfH46G" class="uri">https://uwmadison.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6zzSu1ddmyfH46G</a></p>
<p><em>Now I am going to tell you about the study goals and about the risks, benefits, and protections associated with being a participant in the study.</em></p>
<p><em>So - In this study, we will be collecting data from people who are in recovery from opioids because we want to identify the feelings, events, and behavior patterns that can lead to using opioids and other drugs.</em></p>
<p><em>A lot of people in recovery have “slips,” where they use opioids but are still committed to recovery. These slips are sometimes called “relapses,” “episodes,” or “lapses.” And while slips may seem to come out of nowhere and take people by surprise, research has found evidence of warning signs like really stressful events, big changes to life circumstances, changes in moods, or being around friends or places that remind people of their past use.</em></p>
<p><em>So- the goal of the STAR study is to try to find new warning signs. We are looking for warning signs in two different kinds of information.</em></p>
<p><em>First, we are looking for warning signs in information that people provide about their own experiences – so these are things like people’s moods, experiences of stress, urges to use, and how much people want to avoid using. This type of information will come from daily and monthly surveys that participants fill out.</em></p>
<p><em>Second, we are looking for warning signs in information that people do not need to tell us about, and that people might not even know about themselves. For example, people’s recent messages or where they go could contain a warning sign. People’s routines and patterns or changes to their routines and patterns could also contain warning signs. We gather this type of information from smartphone data including phone call logs, texts, and location.</em></p>
<p><em>So far, I have given examples of times when people are at greater risk of using opioids, but in this study, we are also looking for positive signs. People tend to do better in recovery when they are happy, have meaningful contact with other people, and when they have healthy habits and routines.</em></p>
<p><em>For this study to predict future opioid slips, we will need information about when slips have happened. This means that participants in this study will be asked every day if they have used opioids; and when they used the opioids.</em></p>
<p><em>So that is the main purpose of the study. Do you have any questions?</em></p>
<p><strong>[Answer questions until they have none]</strong></p>
<p>Now I’m going to describe what people are asked to do as participants in our study.<br>
+ <em>Participants download the STAR app onto their phone and have to keep that phone paid for and charged.</em><br>
+ <em>Every day they fill out a short survey that asks how they are doing.</em><br>
+ <em>Once a month, they fill out a longer survey that asks about their thoughts and experiences in the last month.</em></p>
<p><em>I’d also like to tell you more about what we’ll be doing with the smartphone data that people share with us. After I tell you about each item I’ll pause and ask if you have any questions.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>People will be asked to give the app permission to access their phone data, text messages, and their location data.</em><br>
</li>
<li><em>For phone data, our computer will be able to see the numbers of people you call or message frequently, and the name you have given them in your Contacts, if any. For example, we might see “this participant texted or spoke with 608-555-1234 four times over the last month. This person is saved in their contacts as Joe Smith”. We will use this information only to ask you generic questions about whether talking to this person is harmful or helpful to your recovery.</em><br>
</li>
<li><em>For text messages, our computer is able to read only the text of SMS messages you have sent or received. The computer cannot see any images you might send in texts, or any messages sent using other apps like Snapchat or Facebook. The study team cannot see your actual texts in real time; and we cannot “read your messages”. Near the end of the study, our computer will sort through the words in the messages to tell us general things about people’s messages. For example, “people in this study used the word ‘stressed’ in their texts much more often before they had a slip” or “this person used the word”happy” more often when talking to a person they told us was helpful to their recovery”</em><br>
</li>
<li><em>For location data, our computer will be able to look through the GPS points recorded by your phone and use those to identify places you have spent time at. For example, the computer might tell us “this person has visited 101 Main Street two times in the last month”. We will use this information only to ask you generic questions about whether visiting this location is helpful or harmful to your recovery. We cannot “see where you are” in real-time and won’t know anything about these places other than what you choose to tell us. I also want to reassure you that you will be able to delete any phone logs or SMS messages that you don’t want us to see, and you will be able to turn off your location sharing if you don’t want us to see where you go for a period of time.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Participation in the STAR study is totally voluntary. The study lasts up to one year, but you can stop being part of the study at any time. To remain enrolled, people have to complete most tasks, meaning all monthly updates and at least 6 daily updates per week, and share their phone, text message, and location data. If someone is not able to keep up with tasks or does not want to share their data anymore, we will talk with them and may decide to stop their participation early.</em></p>
<p><em>It is important that you know that any use of opioids or other drugs has no effect on your participation. You can continue to participate regardless of when or how many times you might use opioids or other drugs. It is only important that you honestly report any opioid or drug use when asked about it in the surveys.</em></p>
<p><em>Next we’ll go over study risks and benefits. There are no major risks related to participation in this study. If you decide to participate, the main risk is that someone might see your information who should not.</em></p>
<p><em>For this reason, we are very careful and have created safeguards regarding how your data is stored and accessed. Protecting your data and privacy is our top priority, and we are overseen by a group at the University of Wisconsin-Madison that exists to protect and help research subjects. With their guidance, we follow careful protocols for storing, using, and sharing any information that could be used to find out who participants are.</em></p>
<p><em>Some examples of how we will protect your information and reduce the risk that someone might see it:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>We store your contact information like your name and address in a locked location that is separate from the study data.</em><br>
</li>
<li><em>We label study data with an anonymous study id number.</em><br>
</li>
<li><em>When we share results and data with other researchers, we will not share information that could be used to find out who participants are, like their location data.</em><br>
</li>
<li><em>We will only ever give group summaries of demographic information like people’s age, gender, and race or ethnicity.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>There are no direct benefits of taking part in this study. The STAR app that participants use was designed to help people in recovery and might help you, but we are not treatment providers, and this study is not a treatment. Of course, our team does hope that in the future, what we learn in this study will be used to improve treatments for other people in recovery.</em></p>
<p><em>We will compensate people who participate in the study for as long as they choose to do so. If you decide to enroll, you will earn:</em><br>
+ $20 for the first phone visit (that’s this visit)<br>
+ $10 for a phone call in a week to check in about the study<br>
+ $10 for a phone call at the very end of the study</p>
<p><em>There will be only 3 calls total over the entire 12-month course of the study. This call counts as one of those three calls. To be clear, we will NOT be calling or checking-in on you regularly aside from the surveys you complete in-app.</em></p>
<p><em>For every task you complete in the app you will earn payments, and you can also earn bonuses for meeting target goals, with payments up to about $70 per month.</em></p>
<p><em>Again, we will also pay you an additional $50 a month to help cover the cost of your monthly phone bill.</em></p>
<p><em>Compensation will be provided via a payment debit card that we will mail to you after successful download of the STAR app. Once compensated for the completion of your initial calls and training, you will receive payment on your designated date once a month.</em></p>
<p><em>All of that said, this study was not designed to make money for the research team or anyone else. If you participate in the study and if the research team develops products from this study, you will not receive any profits. It is also important to let you know that one member of the STAR research team partially owns the company that makes the study app, and as such they may financially benefit from this research study.</em></p>
<p><em>Based on what I have shared, what questions do you have for me? [Answer questions]</em></p>
<p><em>The information I just gave you about the study goals and the risks, benefits, and protections are things that we make sure everyone who is thinking about joining the study hears and understands.</em></p>
<p><em>The next step of the process is to make a formal decision about whether you want to be part of the study. In a minute, I’ll have you click on that link I sent you, which will show you a Consent Form with all the information I just reviewed stated in more technical language. Then you’ll be asked if you are ready to decide if you want to participate. If you do, you’ll be asked a few questions, and these will take information that we need to pay you and help make sure our study includes different types of people.</em></p>
<p><em>Then, finally, you’ll download the app and set up an account.</em></p>
<p><em>Now is the time to open that link that I texted you. You should see a document that says “Consent Form” at the top. You can take as much time as you like to read it over and let me know when you are done. I can sit quietly here in case you have any questions. You’ll also be able to download a copy of the consent form if you would like to continue now and read over the full document later or save a copy for your records. Alternatively, if you would like to take some time to think about things, I would also be happy to schedule a follow-up call with you later. So would you like to read it now, continue, or get back to us?</em><br>
<strong>[When done]</strong><br>
<em>Do you have any questions or anything you want me to know?</em></p>
<p><strong>[Answer their questions or move on if not]</strong><br>
<em>You now have three options. You can decide to participate, decide not to participate, or you can take more time to make this decision.</em></p>
<p><em>If I have answered your questions, and you feel you understand the information in the consent form please tap “Continue” and then select “Yes, I am ready to say”yes” or “no” to participating in this study”.</em></p>
<p><strong>[If not ready]</strong></p>
<p><em>That’s understandable and I’m glad you’re going to take more time. You should feel free to discuss the consent with anyone if you feel it will benefit you. It’s very important for you to be fully informed and not feel pressured before you consent.</em></p>
<p><em>You can go ahead and download the consent form by tapping the link on the screen that reads “Click here”. After you have read and considered them, please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have more questions. We can schedule a time window in the next few days for someone from our team to call back and discuss if you still want to participate after you have had time to review the consent form. Does that work for you?</em></p>
<p><strong>[If no]</strong><br>
<em>That’s okay, we very much appreciate your time and interest in this study. Have a great day!</em></p>
<p><strong>[Answer any remaining questions and complete the telephone visit. No payment given]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[If need more time to think about it]</strong><br>
<em>That’s fine, you can text this number (608-571-3810) if you have any additional questions or if you make a decision. Otherwise, I will reach out to you in about one-week to check-in on how the decision making process is going and answer any additional questions that you might have.</em></p>
<p><strong>[Pick a time window to call, Answer any remaining questions and complete the telephone visit. Then put the follow up call on the star_psych@wisc.edu google calendar. No payment given]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[If yes]</strong><br>
<em>Okay, great. Please type your full legal name into the space provided. This will function as your electronic signature. Once you are done, please pause and let me know.</em></p>

Then, you will be asked to provide an email you would like to use for the STAR app. Next, you’ll be asked to provide a mailing address that we will use to send you the payment debit card, and a W-9 form.</em></p>
<p><em>The W-9 form will come with instructions on how to complete it and a pre addressed envelope. We will not be able to send you your first monthly payment until it is returned, so it is crucial you get this back to us. How you do so is up to your discretion–you can either mail it or take a clear picture and send this to our hotline phone number, which we will provide after the call. If you choose to send an image, we can call over the phone to get your SSN.</em></p>
<p><em>We will mostly communicate with you through the study app, but we occasionally use your email address to get in touch with you. Then the final screen page of questions will ask you to select when you started your medication assisted treatment, as well as your race/ethnicity and date of birth.</em></p>

<p><em>I want to take some time to tell you a bit about the STAR user guidelines. These guidelines were designed to make sure our participants and staff are protected and are treated professionally and with respect.</em></p>
<p><em>Briefly, our guidelines are…</em></p>
<p><em>To always use respectful language on app discussion boards or in communication with study staff,</em></p>
<p><em>To communicate with staff and other STAR participants as you would in a professional work setting,</em></p>
<p><em>And to avoid sharing personal or private information on the public discussion boards.</em></p>
<p><em>Any questions about these guidelines?</em></p>
<p><em>All in-app messages, posts, and phone calls with staff are subject to review by the STAR team, and staff will remove any discussion post, comment, or individual member who does not follow these guidelines.

<p><em>The final step of enrolling in the study will be to watch tutorial videos that describe the app’s recovery resources and explain how to complete the different study tasks. You can find these video tutorials in a text message I will send to you shortly after we complete this phone call.</em></p>
<p><em>Completing these video tutorials will take about 35 minutes [3] and you will be compensated $20 for your time.</em></p>
<p><strong>(Training Video Link: <a href="https://uwmadison.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_89fOXmASpmTIFEy" class="uri">https://uwmadison.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_89fOXmASpmTIFEy</a>)</strong></p>
<p><em>If you experience any issues either with the video tutorials or completing any of the study tasks, please do not hesitate to email or call us.</em></p>
<p><em>We’ll want to call you in one week to see how everything is going with your participation. This will be a very brief call, only about 5 minutes and you’ll receive $10 compensation for its completion.</em></p>
<p><em>So, one week from now will put us at {insert date that is one-week from onboarding session}. Does that sound like it will work for you?</em></p>
<p><em>And would you like to keep the same time or select a new one?</em></p>
<p><strong>[If no, pick another day either before or after 7 days]</strong></p>
