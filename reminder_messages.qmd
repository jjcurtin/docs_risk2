## Read before Sending any Reminders

STAR staff will send consent/onboarding session reminders via text the day prior to visits. Staff can use the Google Voice helpline number (the uwmstarstudy\@gmail.com account) for this. 

Please include the time in the participant's Time Zone **first**, followed by Central time IF DIFFERENT. For example: 1pm Eastern time/ 12pm Central time. 

When you are sending reminders that aren't for tomorrow - for example, if you are sending a Monday visit reminder, on a Friday - PLEASE be sure to change "tomorrow" to the actual day of the visit!


### How to get time zones:

To get time zones for a Consent/Onboard session:

Copy and paste the following code in the Console pane of RStudio; then hit enter to run:
```r

library(tidyverse)
library(here)


path_lab_support <- "../lab_support"
path_data_admin <- "P:/studydata/risk2/data_admin/"

source(here("functions", "fun_star.R"))
source(here(path_lab_support, "fun_gps.R"))


path_admin <- "P:/administration"
token_qualtrics <-
  read_csv(file.path(path_admin, "credentials.csv")) %>%
  filter(resource == "qualtrics") %>%
  pull(token)

screen <- tidy_qualtrics("screening", token_qualtrics,  display_progress = FALSE, raw=TRUE) %>% select(eligible_first_name:LocationLongitude)
```

Click on the "screen" dataframe at the top-right hand side and search by their phone number or email. Look for the column "screen_state". There's also latitude/longitude columns that you can copy & paste into google (put a comma between them) and google will tell you the location zip code and you can use that to check the time zone: ie. 38.946106, -89.417999


To verify the time zone of a current participant (1-week or final visit):

Copy & paste the following code in the Console pane of RStudio (hit enter to run):

```r
enroll <- tidy_qualtrics("enroll", token_qualtrics) #load enrolled
```
Then click the "enroll" dataframe at the top-right hand side and search for the subid. You will see their city/state/zip which you can use to google their time zone.
