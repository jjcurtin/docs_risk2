# Reminder Texts

<center>(This SOP has scripts for reminder texts to send to participants before their calls)</center>

Â 

#### Read before Sending any Reminders

STAR staff will send consent/onboarding session reminders via text the day prior to visits. Staff can use the google voice helpline number (the uwmadison\@gmail.com account) for this. Please include the Central Time Zone and the participant's Time Zone

To get participants' time zones, go to screen_eda.rmd which can be found in analysis_risk2 \>\> dev \>\> screen_eda.rmd. Select all scripts above the line marked with the red dot before "%\>%", and hit run. Click on the "screen" dataframe at the right hand side to view people who are screened eligible. Search their time zone by their phone number or email.
