# Screening Survey

These questions are about participating in a research study. We are
looking for people 18 years old or older, who are receiving medication
assisted treatment (MAT) from an outpatient treatment program or
doctor's office-based treatment program, or people who are enrolled in
or have recently completed a day treatment program (DTP, also known as a
partial hospitalization program or PHP).

The study involves using a smartphone recovery support app for one year.
You would complete brief daily check-ins and daily and monthly updates,
and meet virtually with study staff twice for about thirty minutes.

Interested participants who qualify to be in the study and complete
study tasks will receive a \$50 per month personal cell phone plan
credit and up to \$70 per month in study task completion bonuses, paid
by check or reloadable debit card.

First, we would like to ask you several questions that determine whether
you might be a good fit for this study. We will ask about your
smartphone usage, about you, and about any medication assisted
treatments you might be taking or day treatment programs you are
enrolled in.

If you prefer to talk to study staff first and then answer these
questions over the phone, you may instead call our study line and leave
a voicemail at 608-262-1362

participate. This screening survey is voluntary; you can end your
participation at any time by closing the survey.

If we determine that you are not a good fit for this study after
