# Literature Review Summaries

## Opiate Use Patterns Review:

-   The purpose of this review is to inform how we ask people about
    opioid lapses (e.g., creation of time windows to report a lapse),
    routes of administrations, and types of opioids used for non-medical
    reasons Opiate Use Patterns First, opiate use patterns appear to be
    not as clear cut as one would think and there is little research on
    rates of drug administration. One study specifically examines opiate
    consumption at a heroin maintenance program in Geneva (Perneger et
    al., 2000). At this program heroin users are prescribed heroin and
    oral opiates as needed without any limit to the amount prescribed
    (wow!). On about 50% of total patient-days (days researchers
    documented consumption) patients used a combination of intravenous

    (IV) heroin and oral opiates (methadone and/or oral morphine;
         Perneger et al., 2000). This brings me to my first observation:
         participants may not be using just one opiate type. Perneger et
         al.

    <!-- -->

    (2000) found that the average daily dose of IV heroin was about 500
           mg taken in three injections throughout the day. This dose
           was slightly lower when taken in conjunction with oral
           opiates, which lowered IV users' number of injections by one
           or two injections on average. One thing to note about this
           research is that it is on heavy users. So, my second thought
           is: participants who are relapsing after periods of
           abstinence may have different consumption patterns than
           regular users. This deviation could go either way --
           resulting in higher (i.e., they could binge one night on the
           entirety of drugs they pick up) or lower consumption (i.e.,
           they have a slight lapse and only use one time). Evidence
           from the previously mentioned study supports the latter.
           Perneger et al.
    (2001) found that when higher amounts of oral methadone was
           administered, fewer amounts and number of injections of IV
           heroin was documented. One patient, representing a typical
           pattern seen in the study, was able to decrease their daily
           injections from three injections to two to one by increasing
           their oral methadone dosage each time (Perneger et al.,
           2000). It is not clear, however, if this same pattern would
           be seen with other opioid maintenance medications.
           Unfortunately, this information is specific to IV usage and
           heroin. A 2004 study on opioid prescription pill users in a
           methadone maintenance program found that oxycodone and
           codeine were the most commonly abused pills (Brands et al.,
           2004). The same study reports that the average number of
           pills taken per day prior to treatment was about 20 -- 22
           tablets per day (Brands et al., 2004). Table 1 (taken from a
           different study) illustrates the average daily dose (mg),
           heaviest dose (mg) in a day, and route of administration used
           for various opiate prescription pills (Sproule et al., 2009).

Table 1. From Sproule et al. (2009). Users of controlled-extended
release oxycodone take on average higher daily doses than other opiate
prescription pills. Other issues to consider are route of administration
and variation in duration of the high for different opiates. According
to an older research report put out by the National Institute on Drug
Abuse, a typical heroin user will inject up to four times a day
(National Institue on Drug Abuse, 2000). There does not appear to be the
same available data for other routes of administration, but with the
lower bioavailability of the drug seen in routes like smoking (Rook et
al., 2006), it is likely they are used more frequently.
Sniffing/snorting heroin is the second most common route of
administration followed by smoking (National Institue on Drug Abuse,
2000). However, one newer study suggests sniffing is the most common
route of administration, even surpassing injection (Ihongbe & Masho,
2016). With opioid prescription pills, chewing is the most common route
of administration (Gasior et al., 2016; Sproule et al., 2009). However,
some research suggests choice in route of administration is influenced
by external factors. One study reported that route of administration
varied as a function of both type of prescription opioid and whether the
user was from a rural or urban community (Young et al., 2010). For
example, rural users were more likely to snort hydrocodone tablets
whereas urban users were more likely to swallow/chew the tablets (Young
et al., 2010). One final consideration is the comorbidity of drug use
common in opiate addiction (Brands et al., 2004; Monga et al., 2007). In
one sample of 114 opiate users, 97% reported using other non-opiate
drugs in the past 30 days, with alcohol (70%), cannabis (64%), and
benzodiazepines (60.5%) being the most prevalent (Fischer et al., 1999).
A larger study on 1075 opioid users reported that 54% of the sample
regularly used benzodiazepines and 59% regularly used stimulants
(Marsden et al., 2000). I do not think this is a concern currently for
us; however, I think it is worth noting as it is possible that certain
drugs may have synergistic effects with opioids resulting in more or
less frequent drug administrations. Ultimately, this still doesn't
answer our question about the exact dosing frequency of opioid users who
are not injecting heroin. To help guide us in making decisions for
RISK2, I have also attached a table exhibiting the half-lives of various
opiates (Table 2) and a table of duration of action for the same opiates
(Table 3). From these tables you will see that the average duration of
action for each of these opiates is around 3 -- 6 hours. As a result, I
would recommend that a time window of three hours is sufficient for
measuring opioid lapses if needed. Furthermore, due to lack of research
on opiate administration/use patterns it might be worth it to discuss
whether we want to collect this information. For example, when a
participant reports their lapse, they could also report the type of
opiate (i.e., prescription pill, heroin, other) and the route of
administration used (i.e., snorting/sniffing, smoking, IV, other).

Table 2. From Trescot et al. (2008). Not listed above is heroin
(diamorphine/diacetylmorphine) which has a half-life of .1 - .25 hours

## EMA Pain Item Review

-   The purpose of this review is to determine the convergent and
    criterion validity for a daily EMA pain item, and to inform how we
    ask participants about their daily pain

A review of convergent and criterion validity for a daily EMA pain item
Note: The following bibliography primarily focusses on research using a
single EMA measure of pain intensity (i.e., daily "worst pain" question
from BPI ). I could not find an example from a study on patients without
chronic pain so the following draws on a variety of different types
participant samples actively excluding cancer samples. Kratz, A. L.,
Murphy, S. L., & Braley, T. J. (2017). Ecological Momentary Assessment

<https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apmr.2017.07.002> Sample: Multiple Sclerosis
participants (N = 107) Measure modality: EMA and end-of-day diaries
Measure: Pain intensity (1 question on EMA, 3 questions on end-of-day
diary) 1. EMA: "What is your level of pain right now?" -- 0 ("no pain")
to 10 ("worst pain imaginable") 2. End-of-day: Asked participants to
rate their daily "worst", "average", and "current" pain -- 1 ("no pain")
to 5 ("very severe") Measure source: EMA from Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)
(Daut, Cleeland & Flanery, 1983); diaries from Patient Reported Outcomes
Measurement Information System (PROMIS; Revicki et al., 2009 ). Validity
type: Convergent Validity stats: Shared between-person variance for
daily EMA and end-of-day pain intensity constructs, beta = 1.91, SE =
0.05, p \< .0001, R2 = .798 Other notes: Also reported within (1.99,
41%) and between person (2.89, 59%) variance in EMA single pain item.
Important to note that they used BPI "right now" instead of "worst pain"
question on EMA but did ask about worst pain on end-of-day diary.

of pain intensity and interference. In introduction authors mention that
"worst pain" item on BPI is commonly used as a single item measure. They
do not expand on this thought though. I think this study is important
because it seems to confirm that the research I found in my last draft
can extend to non-cancer patients with varying degrees of pain. This is
helpful because most of the research using the BPI (and single "worst
pain" item) are on cancer patients.

BPI data collected from non-cancer pain patients was comparable to that
reported in the literature for cancer patients and sufficient for
group-level analyses (coefficient alphas were greater than 0.70). The
factor structure of the BPI was replicated in this sample and the
relationship of the BPI to generic measures of pain was strong. The BPI
exhibited similar relationships to general and condition-specific
measures of health as did a generic pain scale (SF-36 Bodily Pain).
Finally, the BPI discriminated among levels of condition severity and
was sensitive to change in condition over time in arthritis and LBP
[lower back pain] patients." Above is from abstract, have not gotten
access to this article yet. It was cited in the above study and seems to
work to again support the BPI for use in non-cancer pain patients.

<https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1526-4637.2009.00774.x> - "Throughout BPI
validation, the item"pain at its worst in the last 24 hours" has
consistently shown the highest degree of internal consistency, with
Cronbach's alpha coefficients ranging from 0.77 to 0.90." (See Table
2) - "When examining test--retest reliability, the"pain at its worst in
the last 24 hours" item had acceptable reliability during validation of
the BPI in German and Taiwanese subjects (0.80 and 0.96,
respectively)." - "The test--retest reliability of the"pain at its worst
in the last 24 hours" item is highest when administered over a short
time span (i.e., hourly or daily), suggesting these may be the optimal
intervals during future drug trials." - "During instrument
development,"pain at its worst in the last month" was tested as an item
rather than "pain at its worst in the last 24 hours." The "pain at its
worst in the last month" item was found to be highly related to pain
interference items, consistent with the pattern of relationship between
"pain at its worst in the last 24 hours" and pain interference items in
subsequent studies." - Note: these above findings are in the context of
validating the BPI worst pain item as a measure of pain reduction in
clinical treatment. Not sure how this may affect what we are looking
for.

## Progress Tracking Review

-   The purpose of this review is to summarize a literature search
    related to progress tracking and messaging, and to inform how we
    will allow and encourage participants to track their progress in the
    study with respect to study task completion Progress tracking and
    messaging literature search (The purpose of this review is to
    summarize a literature search related to progress tracking and
    messaging, and to inform how we will allow and encourage
    participants to track their progress in the study with respect to
    study task completion) Progress tracking: • We can disassociate
    points from \$ bonuses. Merely framing something as a game (e.g.,
    using visual signals of gaming) seems to be motivating (e.g.,
    Lieberoth, 2014). It might make sense for us to keep the current
    payment scheme but additionally reinforce completion of individual
    surveys with a more detailed points tracker (which when clicked can
    still show amount earned). • People should accumulate points for
    incremental progress. Every time people complete a survey / do
    something we want them to do, they should get points even if there
    is no financial earning. • We should provide positive messages
    and/or images upon completion of every survey. We need to positively
    reinforce completion of surveys. For example, when people complete a
    survey maybe we show a star on the daily survey button, when people
    complete all daily surveys in a week, the tracker bar could turn
    green. • We should take inspiration from existing apps (e.g.,
    fitbit, strava). Private companies have poured a ton of money into
    testing progress trackers so it will be wise for us to look at how
    other apps function and use similar design features or language. • I
    didn't find great papers on 'streak' feedback but I know this is
    popular on apps like Duolingo, so we might consider it (although it
    could backfire if people aren't consistent... and maybe we don't
    care that much about streaks) On messaging (e.g., if we incorporate
    text under the tracker or for notifications/reminders) • We should
    incorporate meaning/value information in messages. Occasionally
    reminding people why we want them to complete surveys will probably
    be motivationally beneficial (e.g., 'Filling out surveys will help
    improve scientific understanding of relapse risk'; general support
    for this comes from theories of motivation (SDT, expectancy-value)
    but also supported by evidence in 'gamification' literature like
    Mekler et al., 2013). • We should vary message content based on
    progress. Shifting the reference point strategically can increase
    motivation (Wallace & Etkin, 2018). For example, we should be vague
    about goals when people are doing badly, so if people have completed
    0 surveys we say something like "Complete more surveys to earn a
    bonus this week" rather than something like "Complete at least 5
    surveys to earn a bonus this week" (or whatever our compensation
    scheme is). When people are doing well, we should be specific and
    focus on what remains versus how much progress they have already
    made... so e.g., when 6/7 daily surveys are done, rather than saying
    something like 'You've completed six of seven surveys required to
    earn a bonus.' we say 'Complete one more daily survey to earn a
    bonus' • If our in-app notifications are attention-grabbing, we
    should allow people to control the frequency of and/or disable them.
    If notifications annoy people, and if people habitually ignore
    notifications, they will not work.

## Risky Dates Review

-   The purpose of this review is to summarize the literature
    surrounding meaningful dates and its relationship to substance use.
    It was also used to inform our decision to not ask participants to
    report potentially "risky dates")

Event -Based Substance Use Often referred to in the literature as
event-based or event-level substance use, there appears to be a general
consensus that specific meaningful dates, events, and contexts are
associated with increased likelihood of substance use on or immediately
after said date, event, or context. Somewhat unsurprisingly, the
majority of this event-based substance use research has focused on
drinking patterns among college-aged populations (Stanesby, Labhart,
Dietze, Write & Kuntsche, 2019). Consequently, the events that have
received the most attention are those that have been identified as
having a unique relevance to college-aged populations (21st birthdays,
Spring Break, Frat Parties, Collegiate Sporting Events)(Patrick & Azar,
2018). Despite this methodological skew towards college-aged
populations, I did come across a handful of event-based studies that
included clinical, older, and more diverse populations. The events
investigated in these studies included Holidays, Sporting Events, and
Disaster/Terror Events.

Holidays Predictably, people tend to drink more on certain holidays. In
fact, a report by Mothers Against Drunk Driving put out a report on the
top ten holidays with the highest number of alcohol related accidents 1.
New Years Holiday, 2. Labor Day, 3. Fourth of july 4. Super Bowl Sunday
5. Christmas 6. Memorial Day 7. Fourth of July (2002) 8. Thanksgiving,
9. Halloween 10. St. Patrick's Day (Lapham, Forman, Alexander,
Illeperuma & Bohn, 2009). However, increases in high-intensity drinking
may depend on the holiday in question. One study observed that on
family-oriented holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmas, the number
of young people who consumed alcohol increased but the average number of
drinks consumed per person (counting only those who drank) actually
decreased (Goldman,Greenbaum, Darkes, Brandon, Del Boca, 2011). In
contrast, on holiday weeks that included a Halloween-like holiday, New
Year's Eve, and the Fourth of July, the average number of drinks
consumed per drinker increased significantly compared with non-holiday
weeks (Goldman et al., 2011). Though it is unclear whether these trends
would translate into increased risk of opioid lapse given the
considerable difference in social use of the two substances, if RISK 2
participants are polysubstance users, it is possible that increased risk
of holiday drinking would increase the risk of opioid lapses.
Interestingly, there is evidence that using medication to assist with
substance use disorder can be helpful in reducing holiday substance use.
One study investigating the effect of Naltrexone combined with
psychosocial support on holiday drinking in treatment seeking
populations with AUD found that taking Naltrexone was associated with
near-complete abstinence during the holidays (Lapham et al., 2009).

Sporting Events Sporting events are also associated with risky drinking
behavior. Among college football fans, particularly men, drinking on
days of high-profile football games is as heavy as alcohol consumption
on other well known drinking days, including New Year's Eve and
Halloween weekend (Neal & Fromme, 2007). Another study that looked at
three years worth of drinking data found that heavy drinking male
participants drank significantly more of Super Bowl Sundays compared to
other heavy drinking days (Saturdays) across all three years, while
women's drinking was higher in only one of those three years (Dearing,
Twaragowski, Smith, 2014). These findings suggest sporting events
present a significant risk for risky substance use, especially among
men. Disaster/Terror Events and Substance Use Given that we will have
negative anniversaries as a category on the risky dates question, I
looked at articles that covered the effect of disaster/terror events on
substance use behaviors. Most of the research I found on this topic
covered substance use in participants exposed to terror attacks,
specifically 9/11 and the 1995 Oklahoma City Bombing (Vlahov et al.,
2002; Pfefferbaum et al.,2002; Welch et al., 2014; DiMaggio & Galea,
2009). These studies generally found that those individuals who reported
high or very high exposure to the event reported increased smoking and
increased alcohol intake. Critically, these effects on participant
substance use behavior were observed in those individuals with high or
very high exposure to the event,up to a decade after exposure,
regardless of PTSD diagnoses (Welch et al., 2014; Welch, Zweig, McAteer
& Brackbill., 2017). Similar increases in substance use behavior have
been observed in Jewish settlers who were directly injured during the
intifada, particularly male settlers who had "sustained traumatic events
with a great risk to personal integrity" (Keinan-Boker, Kohn, Billig &
Levav, 2011). It is important to note that these studies were unable to
establish any sort of causal relationship between the terror attacks and
increased substance use. They do, however, suggest that traumatic
exposure to a specific event is an important risk factor for risky
substance use, especially if the individual is directly impacted by the
event.\
While these studies demonstrate a significant relationship between
increased substance use and certain meaningful dates and events, it is
worth noting that the majority of these studies did not explicitly
discuss relapse. Additionally, I did not find any research papers that
had actually measured the relationship between sobriety anniversary and
relapse. In the course of my search, I found a few non-research article
sources, namely blog posts and online recovery resources (See
References), that identify sobriety anniversaries, holidays, and
recovery milestones as possible triggers for relapse. This dearth in the
literature, especially as it relates to opioid use disorder, underscores
the value of collecting this data as part of RISK 2. However, weighed
against the clear burden of asking individuals to report risky dates and
the lack of clarity as to what might constitute a "risky" date to
individuals in recovery, we have decided not to ask about risky dates in
RISK 2.

## Motivational Constructs Review

-   The purpose of this report was to consider how the RISK 2 measures
    are directly and indirectly assessing motivation in the context of
    motivational construct literature

Motivational Constructs in Risk 2 Across the daily, monthly, and intake
survey, we have one item that directly measures participants' motivation
"How motivated are you to completely avoid using opioids for non-medical
reasons?". However, given the "growing consensus that motivation
involves multiple constructs", it is worthwhile to consider measuring
additional "theoretically relevant predictors of motivation"
(DiClemente, Doyle, & Donovan, 2009). Norozi et al. (2017) sought to
investigate potential predictors of motivation by focusing on three
cognitive constructs, perceived avoidance self-efficacy, perceived
social support, drug quitting outcome expectancies. Of these three
cognitive constructs, two are represented in the current RISK 2 surveys.
Perceived avoidance self-efficacy refers to an individual's belief in
their ability to avoid drug use, particularly in high risk situations
(Norozi et al. 2017). Several studies have shown that perceived
avoidance self-efficacy is highly related to treatment motivation and
commitment to abstinence (Germeroth et al. 2019; Chauchard et al. 2013;
Laudet & Stanick, 2010). Because perceived avoidance self-efficacy is
believed to fluctuate over the course of treatment, perceived avoidance
self-efficacy is a better predictor of overall treatment outcomes when
it is measured at multiple points during and after treatment (Ilgen
etal, 2005; McKay et al 2013). In RISK 2, we ask participants to report
their perceived avoidance self-efficacy in the Daily Survey using a
single item ("How confident are you in your ability to completely avoid
using opiates for non-medical reasons?"). In the Monthly Update and the
Intake Survey, we have a set questions concerning Abstinence
Confidence/Efficacy: "How satisfied are you with your progress toward
achieving your recovery goals?", How motivated are you to completely
avoid using opioids for non-medical reasons?, How confident are you in
your ability to avoid using opioids for non-medical reasons?, Do you
intend to completely avoid using any other drugs? The other construct
assessed in both Norozi et al. and the current RISK 2 measures is
perceived social support. Norozi et al. used the Multidimensional Scale
of Perceived Social Support (MPSS), a 12-item measure that asks
participants to rate the general social support adequacy from family,
friends, and significant other. Several studies have found that strong
social support is associated with greater treatment retention,
behavioral improvement during treatment, and better treatment outcomes
(Broome et al. 2002, 2010). However, there is also evidence to suggest
that the relationship between social networks and motivation may
undermine recovery efforts if the participant maintains substance-using
network members (Tracey et al. 2009). In RISK 2, Social Support will be
assessed in the Intake Survey and Monthly Update using the Social
Connectedness Scale, Relationship Assessment Scale, and individual items
from the Social Networks Survey (In the past month, how satisfied are
you with... The support you get from your friends, Your personal
relationships). Additionally, the Contacts Report has four items that
directly ask about social support (This person... is a person I can tell
private things to, helps me when I need it, would support me through bad
times, makes me feel good about myself even when mess up) as well as an
item that asks participant to report whether interacting with the
contact put their recovery at risk (How risky are your interactions with
this person to your recovery goals?). The final cognitive construct
Norozi et al. considered was outcome expectancies. Several studies have
demonstrated that addicts' perceptions of the costs and benefits of
quitting can predict treatment motivation (Battjes et al., 2003;
Chauchard et al., 2013; Jackson et al.,2003; Laudet & Stanick, 2010). In
Norozi et al., the researchers created their own Drug Quitting
Consequences Questionnaire, a 23-item measure "that assesses the costs
and benefits of quitting substance use". Following multivariate
analyses, outcome expectancies emerged as a significant predictor of
treatment motivation. However, a more recent study by the same group of
researchers using the same scale found drug quitting outcomes was not a
significant predictor of actual drug abstinence (Eslami et al, 2018).
This inconsistency between predictors of treatment motivation and
predictors of treatment outcomes is seen throughout the literature, with
the predictive ability of outcome expectancies on either treatment
motivation or treatment outcomes varying widely depending on factors
such as the type of outcome expectancies measure, subject demographics,
the stage of treatment and the behavior being assessed. The current RISK
2 measures do not directly assess outcome expectancies. While I did come
across one scale that compressively assesses drug quitting outcome
expectancies, The Perceived Risks and Benefits Questionnaire (PRBQ), it
is both long (39 items) and highly specific to nicotine addiction (See
Figure 1). However, it might be worthwhile to consider creating our own
questions based on the different subscales within the PRBQ (i.e. Health
Benefits, General Well Being, Self-Esteem) which could be added to the
intake survey and monthly survey. I am imagining these items as being
similar in theme to the items in the WHO Quality of Life Scale we are
currently using, but with a more future-thinking orientation. Example
Instructions: Use the scale (1= Very unlikely...7=Very Likely) to rate
how likely each item would be if you were to achieve your recovery
goals - I will lower my chance of developing future health problems - My
overall well-being will be higher - I will have a greater sense of self
esteem Ultimately, there could be some value in gathering information on
how participants outcome expectancies might change over the course of
RISK 2. Gathering such information would not only draw attention to the
potential role of outcome expectancies in predicting opioid lapses, but
also allow us to identify how outcome expectancies interact with
constructs like self-efficacy and social support. However, for the
narrower purposes of RISK 2 I did not find sufficiently compelling
evidence that the value of measuring outcome expectancies would justify
the added burden of a drug quitting outcome expectancies scale.
