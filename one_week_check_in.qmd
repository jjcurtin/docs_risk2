# One-Week Staff Check-In


The purpose of the One Week Check-In is to check-in with participants on
whether they completed the video tutorials, see if they are having any
issue completing the study tasks, and what to expect in the coming
months (i.e. the social contacts/visited locations survey, the burden
questions, and payment)


## 1-week check in

1.  Make sure participants have watched the video tutorials Review data collected\
2.  Ask about issues/concerns\
3.  Ask if participants phone has been dying more than usual Make sure that participants are including their faces in the video check-in\
4.  Provide support for self-regulatory strategies

## Technology check-in

1.  At the end of Consent/Onboarding Session. Participants will indicate times when we can call them or will schedule a specific time.\
2.  Before the call, run a compliance check script to summarize what tasks they have done and see if they have watched the tutorial videos.\
3.  On the call, we will ask them how the study is going, provide any feedback on compliance, and talk about self-regulatory strategies.

## Script

*Hi its {insert name} calling from the Star study. Is this still a good time for you to talk?*

**{if No, Reschedule}**\
*That's ok! Is there a time that would work for you tomorrow or in the next couple of days? This call should take about 10-15 minutes*

**{If Yes}**

Great! Now as you may remember at the end of your onboarding session, I sent you a link with several video tutorials that would explain key aspects of the Star app in detail. Were you able to watch through all of the video tutorials?

{If no}\
That's alright. Can I ask why you did not complete the video tutorials

**Possible Reasons**

-   I lost the link to the videos
    -   *That's ok! Would you like me to send you a new link to the video tutorials at the end of this call? You can still complete the tutorials in the next week to earn an additional \$20 added to your first bonus payment*\
-   I did not get a chance to watch them/I forgot
    -   That's ok! The reason we ask you to watch the video tutorials is because they explain important details about how to set up and use the Star app. Would you like me to send you a new link to the video tutorials at the end of this call? You can still complete the tutorials in the next week to earn an additional \$20 added to your first bonus payment\
-   I don't feel like watching them
    -   That's ok! The reason we ask you to watch the video tutorials is because they explain important details about how to set up and use the Star app but as long as you are completing the study tasks, you can still participate in this study. However, you will be missing out on a potential \$5 bonus you would have received if you watched the video tutorials

**{if yes, pull up their Qualtrics form and see if they had any questions to any of the video. If they submitted questions answer them now}**\
*Great! Thank you for watching the Star video tutorials. Do you have any additional questions about the training materials?*

**{if no additional questions}**\
*Alright! Well, you watched all of the video tutorials which means that you will receive an additional \$20 added to your first study bonus payment.*

*{if yes additional questions}*\
Answer all of their questions and then say:

*Alright! Well, you watched all of the video tutorials which means that you will receive an additional \$20 added to your first study bonus payment.*

*Now I wanted to check in and ask how it is going as far as completing each of the study tasks starting with the monthly update. Were you able to complete the monthly update?*

**(Pause for response)**\
*And how was the monthly update?*

**(Pause for response)**\
*Great and how about the daily updates? Any issues with completing the daily update surveys?*

**(Pause for response)**\
*Do you feel like you are able to make the daily update and daily video check-in a part of you daily routine?*

**{If No}**\
*What aspects of the daily study tasks do you feel you are having the most trouble with?*

*Do you have any other daily habits that you could use to remind you to do your study tasks? (for example, if they always eat breakfast at the same time encourage them to do the tasks before or after breakfast;)*

**{If Yes}**\
*Great!*

*Finally, have you noticed any change in your battery life since download the app? For example, have you noticed it dying more quickly or frequently than usual?*

**{If No}**\
*Great! Well, if it has not impacted your battery life up to this point, it is unlikely that it will negatively impact battery life during the rest of your time on the study. If at any point you start to suspect that your battery life is changing significantly, please reach out to study staff.*

**{If Yes}**\
*Ok. It is normal for certain types of cell phones to be more affected by the STARs app location data sharing, especially if you do not use your phone fairly often throughout the day. I can walk you through how to turn on battery optimization for the STAR app, which should improve the issue.*

**{Explain how to turn on battery optimization}**

**1. Go to Settings**\
**2. Tap "Apps"**\
**3. Tap "STAR"**\
**4. Tap "Battery"**\
**5. Tap "Optimize battery usage"**\
**6. Scroll down to STAR and tap the toggle to the On position (the circle should be on the right and the toggle bar should go from gray to blue)**

*Now I just want to walk you through what you can expect in the coming weeks and months of your participation in the Star study. First, you will be receiving your first study bonus in the next couple of weeks. This bonus will come in the form of a reloadable debit card. Please do not lose or throw away this card. At the end of each month the bonuses you have earned for completing your study tasks will be added to that card. If you do lose or misplace the card, please let us know as soon as possible and we will work with you to get a replacement card. Your first monthly bonus will include payment for the onboarding session, today's call, watching the star video tutorials **(if they completed them)**, and all of the bonuses you earn for completing the study tasks in the first month.*

*Any questions about your study payment?*

*Also, I want to let you know that your next monthly updates will be asking you about the people you talk to (either by text or by phone call) and places you visit over the course of any given month. You will be asked a few questions about each person or place designed to help us understand your relationship to that person or place. Once you have been asked about a person or place, you will not be asked about them again. This means that there may be some months where you are asked about many people or places, and some months where you are asked about very few or no new people or places. As with all the data in this study, any information you provide about the people and places you come into contact with will be kept confidential.*

*Any questions?*

*Additionally, once every few months your monthly update will contain a set of questions that will ask you to report on your experiences as a study participant. These questions are designed to help us understand how people feel about participating in the study and completing the study tasks. Your responses to these questions will be kept confidential and will not affect your study participation in any way.*

*Any questions?*

*Finally, I want to remind you that if you ever have any questions about your participation in the study, the Star app, or the study itself, you can reach out to us by phone or by email. If we determine that it would be appropriate to set up an appointment to troubleshoot through the issue, you would be compensated for the time you spent.*

*Any questions?*

*Ok then! Well {Insert participant name} I want to thank you for your time today and wish you luck with your study participation.*

If they have done this, thank them and confirm that they'll be paid for that this month. If they haven't done this, remind them that they can do so until the end of the month.
-   Probe routines
-   Suggest that participants form a routine or habit for completing all study tasks in the morning.
-   Remind people about what is ahead:
    -   Payment\
    -   Monthly update that will ask about visited places and people.
    -   Later, a monthly update that asks about people's experience participating.
    -   Remind them that they can reach out for help and that they will be compensated for this session and any other trouble-shooting sessions they need to have
