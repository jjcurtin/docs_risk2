# Check Participants on Study   

To check all of the participants that are currently on study, open the RISK2 project and R studio. Type in the following code:   

>all_on_study <- get_on_study(login_creds, token_qualtrics, all = TRUE) %>% 
>                group_by(screen_where, eligible, enrolled) %>% 
>                tally()  

You will get a list of id of participants that are currently on study. You can compare the ids you get from this list to the record in the proj-risk2-admin channel. At the end of each participant thread, you will also see the reason why they ended participation if they are no longer enrolled.
