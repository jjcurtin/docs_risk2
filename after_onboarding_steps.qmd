## Steps To Complete a Successful Onboarding Session

1. **In Google Calendar, mark the onboarding session as DONE.** When you hit save, be sure to select "Do not send" so they are not notified of the change.

2.  **In Google Calendar, add the One-Week Check-In at the appropriate time, labeled with the participant's subid, e.g: "9999 1 week follow up" **. If it is during a time when you will be taking the call, also assign the visit with your designated color.

3.  **Look in the STAR email account to get the participant's subid**: The email subject is "New Onboarding Form submitted"

4.  **Look in the STAR email account to get the participant's subid **: The email subject is "A new person has signed up for STAR." 
    a. Click the email where it says "View their account". This will open the STAR website.
    b. Enter the user's subID in the text box for "Study ID"
    c. Hit save.

2. If the participant is uninterested or ineligible:
