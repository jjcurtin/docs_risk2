# Financal Overview {#sec-financial}

## Compensation

***Overview:*** Total maximum direct compensation will be approximately
\$900 per participant, varying slightly month to month. Additionally, we
also pay \$600 (\$50/month) to offset the costs of participants'
cellular plans. These payments are deposited directly onto the participant's 
payment debit card unless otherwise specifically requested.

***Timing:*** Participants will be on a bonus cycle fixed to the
calendar, defined by \~two-week intervals (i.e., two intervals per
month). If they start the study mid-interval, they will not be able to
earn bonuses for high compliance rates with the surveys, but they will
be able to earn payment for completed tasks and phone and GPS bonuses.
Bonuses will be awarded monthly in the days following the end of the 2nd
two-week bonus cycle.

### Direct Payments

Detailed descriptions of payment procedures are described in SOPs.

Participant payment for study tasks (completing the daily update, daily
video check-in, monthly update, and providing GPS and SMS/phone data)
will be made in the form of refillable debit cards once a month by
default (or by check if requested).

We may provide pilot participants with additional compensation if they
are completing additional study tasks that help us improve study
materials. 

Our contact at US Bank is Evgeni Iliev (evi.iliev\@usbank.com). He is
our first contact if we need help with payments. Jane Foldy
([jane.foldy\@usbank.com](mailto:jane.foldy@usbank.com)) is a secondary
contact for us. We have unassigned cards that we will assign in the US
Bank web portal, issue payment, and reconcile activity. We can reissue
cards if they are lost and help people reset their portal passwords. We
will not see how people spend their money.

To create an account, we need people's name, DOB, a physical address (no
PO Box; we can use the Psychology Dept mailing address if people do not
have a permanent physical address), and a mailing address.

#### Phone Payments

NOTE: As of April 2023 no participants remain on study who are getting payment sent to their phone provider. All participants are now receiving phone payment on their focus blue card.

Payments will be made to participants' phone providers directly from the
p-card. For certain pilot participants, we will deposit \$0.25 or \$1.00
into their account before the one-week check-in. We will ask them to
confirm this at the one week check-in and will get any information we
need from them if that payment fails (e.g., an account number to write a
check to their provider)

Resources:

-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_wireless_communications_service_providers#Largest_U.S._wireless_providers>

For most phone providers, the only information you need to credit money
to an account is the name of the account holder and the billing zip
code.

If we are unable to make payments directly to a participant's cell phone
service provider, we will deposit the \$50 payment directly to the
participant's Focus Blue card  

Payment will be issued on the same day that participants are scheduled
to receive their monthly study task payment.

    \## Payment SOP Risk2 Payment SOP (The purpose of this SOP is to
    detail the instructions for issuing payments to for study tasks and
    cellphone service) Instructions for issuing payments Notes:
    Participants are paid immediate after Consent, on the 15th and 30th
    of each month, and following their final visit.

Payday = 15th for those enrolled on/between the 15th and 29th/30th (or
27th of Feb) of each month compliance_period_1 = 15th - 29th (or 27th
for Feb) compliance_period_2 = 30th of last month (or 28 for Feb) - 14th
of this month

Payday = 30th for those enrolled on/between the 29th/30th (or 27th of
Feb) and the 14th of each month compliance_period_1 = 30th of last month
(or 28 for Feb) - 14th of this month compliance_period_2 = 15th - 29th
(or 27th for Feb) Timing: • First payment: for Consent Onboarding
session, loaded on card when mailed (\$20). • Second payment: for 1-week
check-in and training videos, loaded on card immediately after that
visit (\$30) • Third payment: Paid for all tasks thus far at first
actual paydate (approx. \$20-40 depending on number of days since
consent). ALSO paid for cellular service at this date (\$50) •
Subsequent payments as expected at the assigned pay date, based on the 2
week compliance periods above.

Direct payments. Payments totaling between \$60 to \$665.04 over the
course of the year will be made directly to participants in monthly
increments of \$0 - \$50.42 based on their compliance with study tasks.
In addition, during the first month after participants have enrolled in
the study, they will receive \$20 each for the consent onboarding visit
and for completing pre-study training; and \$10 for the 1 week checkin.

1.  First Payment/System Card Entry

<!-- -->

a.  Participant enrolls successfully and the consent onboarding form is
    submitted. An email trigger is fired to Susan & Ali.
b.  Ali will pull a new focus blue card from the box and fill out a new
    line in the participant payment log
    (`P:\studydata\risk2\administration\financial\participant_payment_logs\participant_payment_log_risk2.csv`).
c.  This line will have the following format: subid date amount
    ra_initials notes upload_notes cardholderID (for registrations) 1004
    4/16/2021 20 SW card registration/consent payment 4049524335

<!-- -->

ii. Cardholder ID is the 10 digit number visible on the card envelope
    (eliminating the first 3 digits which are our site ID).
iii. NB the date should be the actual date on which the \$20 is added in
     Focus Blue. If Susan takes a while to run the registration script
     after Ali makes this entry, Ali will modify this date when she does
     the funding. b.c. Susan uses an R script (INSERT
     LINKrun_register_payment_card.RMD) to get this assigned Focus Blue
     card number from here and generate an upload spreadsheet which
     includes the participants' mailing address from Qualtrics and
     assigned Focus Blue card number. (NOTE: initially card numbers will
     be entered manually) c.d. Participants Susan uploads this
     spreadsheet iare uploaded into Focus Blue to be assignedwhich
     formally assigns the to a card number to the person, and Ali is
     notified that this step is complete. d.e. Ali enters payment
     amounts of \$20 into Focus Blue for each participant (for consent
     session) and notifies Susan that this step is complete. e.f. Susan
     generates the mail merge letters letter
     (`P:\studydata\risk2\methods\sops\messages_sops\first_payment_2021_04_21.docx`
     INSERT LINK) and mailing address addresses labels for each
     participant.

<!-- -->

g.  Each participant is mailed a 6x9 envelope containing the following:
h.  Get the 6x9 envelope; add the STAR return address label and
    participant address label\

<!-- -->

ii. their personalized letter,
iii. Their Focus Blue card envelope
iv. A printed W2 form with the important fields highlighted (see
    sample), f.v. and W2 form withA self-addressed stamped Psych
    letterhead envelope with a stamp and a Star Study address label for
    them to mail back the W2. g.h. Participants will be DMd' by Ali to
    alert them that the payment materials are in transit.
v.  Hello,

2.  One week visit/training payments

<!-- -->

a.  As soon as the one-week visit is complete, Ali will add in Focus
    Blue a \$30 payment for the participant's training (\$20) and visit
    (\$10).
b.  The amount can be modified if training is not complete; or if it is,
    but the visit is skipped.
c.  A record of this will also need to be added into the payment log.
    The note should indicate if the payment is for one or both items.

2.3. Subsequent Regular monthly payments a. Ali Susan runs the daily
monthly script (INSERT LINKrun_monthly_payments.RMD) which on the 15th
and 30th , which will generate an upload csv of participants who need
payment, with the amounts. (including 1 week check-in payments for new
participants and final visit payments for participants going off-study).
i. Susan will use the WOG entries to determine if there is any
compliance forgiveness and adjust the amounts accordingly. a.ii. This
script will also generate lines in the payment log for each participant.
If it is a batch upload, the total amount will be noted on each row for
ease of reconciliation. b. After visual verification and manual edits if
needed, Ali will upload this spreadsheet to the Focus Blue payment
system. i. If the upload is being done a day after the script was run,
please correct the dates in the payment log to match the actual upload
date. b.ii. Also please check that the correct participants are
included! c. Participants will be DMd' by Ali to alert them of the
payment. The DM text is generated by the payment script, and saved to an
individual subid text file in
`P:\studydata\risk2\administration\financial\participant_payment_logs\payment_messages`
i. Hello, You are about X% of the way through the study! During your
first study month you completed X daily updates, X daily video
check-ins, and X intake survey. To earn the highest possible bonus in
the next four weeks, be sure to complete six daily updates per week, and
six daily video check-ins per week, and the monthly update.

We issued a \$47.64 payment to your study card on 2021-05-14. Between
2021-04-21 and 2021-05-14 you earned \$35.24 for study tasks and \$12.40
in bonuses. We issued a \$50.00 payment to your study card on 2021-05-14
to help cover the cost of service for your phone.

Do you have any questions about the payment or the study?

-   The STAR Team

4.  Final payments (early)

<!-- -->

a.  When a participant goes off study early, Susan will use the monthly
    payment script to determine how much they are owed since their last
    payday.
b.  No fund upload spreadsheet will be generated; Ali will add this
    amount in Focus Blue and also manually add it into the payment log.

Cellular plan payments. Payments are made to participants' cellular plan
provider in monthly increments of \$50 at the end of each month of study
participation. (first payday after 1 week visit, either 15th or 30th
depending on signup date) If Susan is unable to make a cellular plan
payment to a participant's provider, she will pay the participant
directly At this time, as the sole authorized P-card holder, Susan will
make all cellular payments.

## Focus Blue Account Reconciliation SOP

Focus Blue account reconciliation SOP
(The purpose of this SOP is to describe the process of how to prepare and submit a Focus Blue account Reconciliation sop)
Overview
The purpose of account reconciliation is to compare different records of deposits and expenses to make sure that they match. Specifically, we compare information directly from our bank account (via the document *Focus Blue reconciliation report*) and from our payment log that ties to our calculated and manually entered payments (*Participant payment log*). The other documents described here document replenishment and help us calculate totals and document expenses.
Document templates are in P:\administration\financial\focus_blue\reconciliations\reconciliation_templates
Submitting reconciliations
1.	Reconciliations are to be submitted within 30 days of the end of each month, e.g., March reconciliation is due before April 30.
2.	Reconciliation is done in the Custodial Funds system: https://www.busserv.wisc.edu/custfundsys; detailed instructions below.
3.	Deindentified required attachments are also sent by email to Gian in Business Services, at cstdnfnd@bussvc.wisc.edu, with a CC to  Psychology Reimbursement at reimb@psych.wisc.edu using the template at the end of this document, so the department can sign off and approve.
4.	Reconciliation materials are to be saved in P:\administration\financial\focus_blue\reconciliations\MM_YYYY and the filename suffixed with YYYY_MMDD. The date should be the last day of the month being reconciled in _YYYY_MMDD format, e.g., March reconciliations should be suffixed_2021_0331 regardless of the day they are actually prepared/submitted.
Required attachments
1.	Focus Blue reconciliation report. [Gian suggested deleting all names before uploading.]
2.	Participant payment log. 
3.	Replenishment request.
4.	Check register worksheet.
5.	Bank reconciliation worksheet.

Preparing the Focus Blue reconciliation report
1.	Log into https://www.usbankprepaidadmin.com and on the top menu bar, select Reports
2.	Under Report Category, select Financial
3.	Under Report Name, select Account Reconciliation Report
4.	Set the date range to the first and last day of the month being reconciled
5.	Select the Program (only one option shows up, select that).
6.	Select the Client Program (U of Wisconsin Madison -Psychology)
7.	Under Select Card ID select U of Wisconsin Madison - Psychology Funding/Disbursement
8.	Under Select Report Format, select Excel.
9.	The download link will appear next to the Export button. 
10.	Delete all columns with identifying information.
11.	Save the report in P:\administration\financial\focus_blue\reconciliations as reconcilation_report_focusblue_YYYY_MMDD.xls
12.	Note the amount under Total Debits. This is the amount to be reconciled and you will need this later.
 
Preparing the Participant payment log
1.	Go to P:\studydata\risk2\administration\financial\participant_payment_logs and open participant_payment_log_risk2.csv
2.	Hit Save As, and save a copy as an EXCEL FILE, in P:\administration\financial\focus_blue\reconciliations named payment_log_focusblue_YYYY_MMDD.xlsx
3.	Delete all rows that are not for the current month and save again.
4.	Make sure the total of Column C matches the Total Debits amount from the Reconciliation Report. If not, something is missing from this payment log, check in with Susan/Ali.
Complete a Check Register Worksheet 
The purpose of this worksheet is to check and show that the balance that we think we have matches the balance that we do have.  
1.	Download a check register worksheet from the business services website under custodian forms https://businessservices.wisc.edu/documents/check-register-worksheet/ 
2.	Document the beginning balance and all written checks, using the information in participant payment log.

Complete a Bank Reconciliation Worksheet 
The purpose of this worksheet is to check and show that the balance that we think we have matches the balance that we do have.  
1.	Create a copy of the bank reconciliation worksheet from the *˜reconciliation templates' folder. This form is not available online and was sent directly from Gian to Hannah.
2.	Input the totals from the check register worksheet and the reconciliation report. Document any outstanding replenishments from all previous months.
Preparing the Replenishment request
1.	The replenishment report is in P:\administration\financial\focus_blue\reconciliation_templates and is named CashAdvanceAccountingForm_focusblue_YYYY_MMDD.xlsx and the easiest way to modify it each month is to make a copy of last months' form, then rename it with the appropriate dated name.
2.	Open your copy. Change the date to the last day of the reconcile month, in 2 spots: B10 and G70 (you may have to search for *date* as UW has locked the form and you can't see row and column numbers except of the cell you're actually in).
3.	 In the center area under Participant Logs, paste the new Total Debit amount as a positive number for the current month (Cell O42). That amount should automatically be populated to 5 other cells in this document!
4.	You should never end up with *voided checks* or a negative replenishment in the Focus Blue system, if you do, check in with Susan.
5.	Add your digital signature if it's not part of the form already.

Uploading into the Custodial Funds System
1.	Log into https://www.busserv.wisc.edu/custfundsys with your netID
2.	Click View on the line where Account Type = Research(Reloadable Debit Card)
3.	In the lower left-hand corner under the *Back to Search* button, you sho0uld see a red text link, *Reconcile Account*
4.	On the next page the top information should tell you what you need to upload. In the bottom left is a dropdown showing the Reconcile Month, be sure to choose the correct one. Hit Save.
5.	A red text link *Add Reconcile Document* will appear. Hit this and it brings up a Choose File button for you to select the upload documents. The Description SHOULD already be populated but instructions say to add the account number and MMYYYY. Choose your file and hit Upload.
6.	To add more documents, you need to hit the green plus icon in the header of the documents table. 
7.	When you finish, hit the radio button that says *Send to Accounting Services for approval* and then the *Submit Selection* button.
