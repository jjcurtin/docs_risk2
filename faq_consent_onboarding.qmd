# Consent/Onboarding Session-Frequently Asked Questions


<center>(The purpose of this FAQ is to serve as a useful reference for study staff while they are Consenting/Onboarding participants. Study staff should feel free to add new questions as they are asked by participants)</center>

#### General tips if you do not understand the question or do not know the answer:

-   Try restating the question to the participant to make sure you understood them\
-   "Can you tell me a little more about what you're concerned about?"\
-   "We have not gotten that question before but I'll send a message to my supervisor/pass that question onto the STAR study coordinator"

**Q: "Can I have my {friend/partner/anyone} here with me?"**

A: Yes! But be aware that we will be asking about sensitive topics, drug use, personal questions.

**Q: "What do you mean by an ongoing cell phone plan?"**

A: By "ongoing cell phone plan", we are talking about a cell phone plan that you pay monthly to the same cell service provider, and that you plan on maintain for the next year

**Q: "What will actually happen when I report lapses?"**

A: We understand that sometimes, slips are a part of recovery. Reporting a lapse will not affect your participation in any way. Also, when you report a lapse, and any other data you provide through the app, that information is fed into a computer algorithm. There is no one actively looking at data as you provide it.

**Q: "What do the payments show up as?"**

A: On your cell phone payments, they should just show up as "online payment"

**Q: "What if I miss a task?"**

A: If you miss one, we understand, just try to complete the next one. But an important part of participating in this study is providing daily or near daily for 12 months, so if you do not think that daily or near daily study tasks will fit into your life, this study may not be a good fit for you.

**Q: "Who will be looking at my text messages?"**

A: Nobody is going to be monitoring your text messages and no matter what we will not be reading your messages, instead the content of your messages will be fed into a computer algorithm. Also any your name and other personal contact information will be removed from the data before it is fed into the computer algorithm.

**Q: "What type of group level characteristics would you use/How would you use my text messages/ what does group level characteristics mean?"**

A: We might mention group level data like the percentage of participants in our study are working but we will never mention. For example, your private message would never show up in a paper, instead we might say the total number of swear words used by participants.

**Q: "Will you be looking at what I put into my motivation/gratitude?"**

A: We will have access to that data however, nobody on staff will be actively monitoring or looking at the text of what you put. Instead, what you put will be fed into your algorithm.

**Q: "Will my cell provider know that I am in this study?"**

A: No. They will only see that they are receiving payment from University of Madison.

**Q: "When would the Certificate of Confidentiality have to be broken?"**

A: If you explicitly communicate via an email, phone visit, or other direct communication that you or others are at risk. But we put in all the stops to not share confidentiality and our research lab has never had to break confidentiality.\
**Follow up Question:** Are there any risks that you are particularly worried about?

**Q: "How would being in this study help me?"**

A: These are not treatments. In similar previous studies people found it helpful however this is NOT treatment.

**Q: "Will this study make me (depressed, anxious, etc)/ Has this study made people (depressed, anxious, etc.)"**

A: Were people depressed while emotional distress is a potential result, it is not a typical response and IRB (oversight committee) reviewed this and determined it to minimal risk.

**Q: "If I drop out, when would the cell service payments stop?"**

A: I am not 100% sure, but it will likely depend on when you decide to withdraw as a participant.

**Q: "Should I delete anything?"**

A: You don't need to delete any data, there is nothing that you would HAVE to delete.

**Q: "Why do you have all of these compliance requirements? (if participant expresses concern/hesitation about the idea of completing the tasks)"**

A: Participation in this study is completely voluntary and we understand that you may not be able to provide data at every point, but the goal of this study is to have participants providing these data so if you are not comfortable with providing any of these data, we can talk about that.

**Q: "How are you going to track all of this if you are not looking at your data?"**

A: It's the algorithm. Our computer algorithm will let us know if a participant is not meeting the minimum data requirements.

**Q: "What if my phone dies a lot?"**

A: We understand that sometimes peoples phone dies or may be lost but if you think that having a fully charged phone for the duration of the study would be challenging this might not be the best study for you.

**Q: "What if I try to provide data but there is no cell service?**

A: If you experience this contact us and we will try to work with you to troubleshoot the issue. If you anticipate that you will not be able to have either cell service or access to WIFI for long periods of time, this study may not be a good fit for you.

**Q: "Do I have to type in my legal name?"**

A: No, all you have to do is provide a full name. Please use your preferred full name.

**Q: Can I tell other people I'm in the study?**

A: You are free to share any information with whoever you feel comfortable with, but we do not provide information to those people
