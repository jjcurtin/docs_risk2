## To Get Response from People Failed to Completed the Check-In  

```html
Hello,    
Our records indicate that you have not yet completed your one-week follow-up call with us. If it would be easier, we can ask you the questions over text. You will still receive $10 for completion if you respond with your answers.

Were you able to watch through the training videos we sent you, and if so, did you have any questions on the material? (If you haven't, but would still like to, you can watch them now at https://uwmadison.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_89fOXmASpmTIFEy . These should take about 35 minutes to complete and you will receive $20 for your time.)

Have you experienced issues completing any of the following:
  + The monthly update  
  + Daily updates  
  + Posting in discussion boards  
  + Have you noticed any change in your phone's battery life since downloading the STAR app?  
  + Have you received your payment card?    

Thank you and have a great day!

## Participant Reports Missing Tasks Due To App Issues

```html
I'm so sorry you had to deal with that! That sounds very frustrating. It looks like you were able to get into the app but I can send along instructions if you would like to have them on hand. Did you miss any tasks because you were locked out? If so, please let me know the dates so that I can credit you those tasks. In the future, if the app is giving you trouble you do not have to spend more than 5 minutes troubleshooting. We will give you credit for any tasks you missed because of this issue.

Thank you and I hope you have a great rest of your day!

Thank you,

## Participant reports app affecting their battery

```html
Hello,
I'm so sorry you're experiencing this issue! To enable the app's battery optimization feature, please follow these quick steps:
1. Go to Settings 
2. Tap "Apps" 
3. Tap "STAR" 
4. Tap "Battery" 
5. Tap "Optimize battery usage" 
6. Scroll down to STAR and tap the toggle to the On position (the circle
should be on the right and the toggle bar should go from gray to blue)

If you would be willing, it would be exceptionally helpful to our developers if you can tell us the specific battery usage on the app. You can do this in one of two ways:

1. Tap Settings.  
2. Tap Battery.  
3. Tap Phone Battery Usage. On some phones, such as Android 11 or Pixel, you'll find the Battery usage option via the three-dot menu at the top right of the Battery page.  
4. The apps are organized in order of which apps use the most power.  
5. Take a screenshot and text the image to the STAR Study Cell Phone  

Or,

1. Tap Settings  
2. Tap Apps & notifications  
3. Find the STAR app in the list of apps and click it  
4. Click Advanced (near the bottom) to show battery usage since last full charge.  
5. Take a screenshot and text the image to the STAR Study Cell Phone  

Thank you for your patience and for your participation!

## Troubleshooting follow-up message

```html
Thank you so much for the information you provided during our call today. Your daily task tracker helped reveal an issue that was previously not on our radar. I reported these issues to our developer team and I will make sure that the payment you receive is consistent with the task completion details you gave me today. In the meantime, please continue to complete the tasks to the best of your ability and know that your contributions have been extremely valuable to our study. We appreciate your participation!

## Participant is using chrome

```html
Hello,  
Our computer has detected that you have been using STAR through Google Chrome rather than on the app. To remain in the study, participants MUST be able to use the app to complete all tasks, otherwise, we are unable to collect data.

If you are able to switch back to the app, there is no need to respond to this message. If you are no longer able to use the app on your phone, please let us know so that we can troubleshoot any problems or discuss ending your participation.

Thank you,
