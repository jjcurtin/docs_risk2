# Mapping P-Drive   

## Connecting to Global Protect  
This procedure is near-identical on both PC and Mac.
1. Open the GlobalProtect client by selecting the icon at the top of your screen (Mac) or in the system tray (PC). (If it does not automatically appear in this place, access the client through your Finder's Applications folder (Mac) or Start Menu (PC).) If it is your first time connecting, you will be prompted to enter a portal address. The default portal is uwmadison.vpn.wisc.edu. If you have used GlobalProtect before, you will be connected to 
the portal you last used. This can be changed by opening the settings menu on the top right of the client login screen.  

2. Enter your netid followed by _1  and password (regular NetID password) and click Sign In. If you are prompted to use Duo MFA, enter the passcode from your fob/Duo Mobile app or
enter "1" to receive a push on your mobile device.
