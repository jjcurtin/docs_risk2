**Green Warning (Missed 8 daily updates and no data for past 4 days)**
```html
Subject: Checking in

Hello,

Our system has notified us that we haven't received any data or updates from you for several days. As a reminder, participants are expected to complete all monthly updates and at least 6 daily updates per week.

I wanted to check-in and see if everything is alright as well as offer some strategies to help remember to complete study tasks. 

Some strategies we have found that help with completing surveys are:
* Set reminder notifications using the STAR app or your phone
* Complete surveys right when you wake up or before bed to get in the habit of completing them

If you are experiencing any problems with the app or have any questions, please let us know.

Thank you so much for your participation!

**Yellow Warning (Missed > 8 daily updates)**

```html
Subject: Missing daily updates

Hello,

Our system has notified us that you have missed X daily updates since the start of your current study month (XX/XX/23).

As a reminder, participants are expected to complete at least 6 daily updates per week. Missing 10 daily updates per month puts you at risk for being withdrawn from the study, so it is very important that you complete all daily updates before the end of your study month (XX/XX/23).

I wanted to check-in and see if everything is alright. Are you having any issues with the STAR App or completing any tasks? 

If you are not having trouble there is no need to reply to this message.

Thank you for your participation!
