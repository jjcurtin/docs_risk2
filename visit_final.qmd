## Debrief Session Script

[The purpose of debrief visit is to remind participants of the goals of
the study, give them a thank you letter, and guide them through deleting

*Italics are script you read to the participant*

**[Items in brackets are instructions to you]**

**Connection**

**[Once the participant is connected (via phone), greet them, then
ascertain they are in a safe and private place to complete the
tele-visit before proceeding. Reschedule If needed.]**

**Introduction** *"Thanks for taking my call today. This call marks the
end of your study participation. I just want to take a few minutes
reminding you of the goals of this study, and how your participation has
contributed to this goal. I will then help you remove the app from your
phone or turn off data sharing if you would like to continue using the
app. Feel free to interrupt me at any time if you have questions.*

**Restate Goals of Study** *As you might remember from the first visit,
the major goal of this study is to use the data you and other
participants provided to develop a system that can predict the
day-to-day chance that an individual with experience an opioid or other
drug lapse.*

*We hope that the system we build, based on data from participants like
you, will improve the treatment landscape for individuals in recovery.*

*Any questions?*

**Thank You Letter** <text/email link to thank you letter>

*On behalf of the research team, I'd like to send you a thank you letter
for your participation. This letter will also have a website link that
you can visit to access additional resources near you.*

**Remove Star App/Change Permissions**

*Now that you are done with the study, you may delete the Star app from
your phone. Although you are not required to delete the star app from
your phone, after the study is over, the app will no longer be updated
and, eventually, may no longer be supported by your phone's operating
system. If you choose to keep the app for the time being, I will help
you change your research study settings to stop sharing your sensitive
data (location, phone logs, and text messages) with us. Would you like
to remove the star app or keep it for now?*

**If Participant Chooses to Remove App**

*To delete the STAR app, press and hold down on the app's icon until the
app shortcut's popup shows up. You'll either see an "i" button or see
App Info; tap it. Next, tap Uninstall.*

**If Participant Chooses Keep App**

*Will fill this in once we get confirmation that participants will be
able to keep the app beyond study end date\> Alright great! I'm going to
walk you through how to turn off data sharing so that we are no longer
collecting your personal information. First, please open the Star App.
Next, tap the Settings button. In Settings, tap Research Study Settings,
next tap "Change Settings". You should get a message from Star notifying
you that changing these settings will reduce your next bonus by \$15,
please tap "Yes"*

*You should be taken to the App info page for Star in your phone
settings. In app info, please tap the "Permissions" button. Please let
me know when you are on this page.*

*Let me know what you see on this page*

*In App permissions, you should see several toggle switches. In order to
turn off data sharing, To change a permission setting, tap it, then
choose Allow or Deny.*

*A permission is turned off when the circle in the toggle is on the
left-hand side. Please let me know when all of the App Permissions are
turned off.*

*Great!*

*Do you have any additional questions about the study?*

**Access Final Results**

*Before you go, I want to give you some information about where you will
be able to eventually find the results from this study. Final results
may take up to 5 years to be published. When they are published, you can
find them at the link provided in the thank you letter we (sent/will
send you?) \<
<https://reporter.nih.gov/search/JbRgAtchAUKHOoW2X1vObQ/projects/map/project-details/9980350>.
All results will be grouped together; therefore, individual results are
not available. Your participation, including your name and answers, will
remain absolutely confidential, even if the report is published.*

*Do you have any questions for me before you leave?*

**Thank Participant/End Session**

*Great! On behalf of everyone at the UW Addiction Research Center I want
thank you so much for participating. We couldn't do this type of
research without volunteers like you.*
