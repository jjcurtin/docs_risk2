## IRB Notes
### Reporting requirements regarding substance abuse and pregnancy
#### Email from Legal 2022/01/13
Based on this information we have decided to ask the IRB to let us remove the pregnancy exclusion criteria.

Hi Susan,

I'm following up on our call just now.  As we discussed, the statutes applicable to reporting substance use by a pregnant woman are as follows:

Section 48.981(2)(d) states that any *person, including an attorney, who has reason to suspect that an unborn child has been abused or who has reason to believe that an unborn child is at substantial risk of abuse may report as provided in sub. (3).*   The emphasis on *may*  is mine.  This is a permissive, not a required, reporting provision.

Per section 48.02(1)(am), the word *abuse*  when used in referring to an unborn child means *serious physical harm inflicted on the unborn child, and the risk of serious physical harm to the child when born, caused by the habitual lack of self-control of the expectant mother of the unborn child in the use of alcohol beverages, controlled substances or controlled substance analogs, exhibited to a severe degree.* 

In discussions I previously had with legal counsel at DHS and DCF, we agreed that if a pregnant woman is seeking out or participating in treatment for her addiction, then the *habitual lack of self-control*  element of the statute would not likely be met and reporting would therefore likely not be appropriate, and could be a privacy violation.

Please let me know if there are additional questions.

## Notes on STAR metadata meanings
NB from Adam: "Sorry for the delay on this! We don't yet have a comprehensive list of all the possible services and actions but our goal is to have them match (or mostly match) what you see/do on the site"

### Login/logout events from app_use table
#### Question: why can we have multiple login actions without logout actions for a user?  
The only way to trigger the "logged in" action is by clicking the Login button on the login page. "user logged self out" is triggered if a person clicks the Logout button in the menu or if they click Logout on the page where you enter your pin.

You will likely see many instances of people not logging out properly if they are testing or using a browser. A non-logout could happen if a person closes the browser or uninstalls the app from their phone before logging out.

Other than that, it is possible to use st_active_tokens to do some detective work about why it could be happening. You can get a user's token in the st_logging_events table then go to st_active_tokens and look for that token. We try to capture as much information about a device as possible which might be helpful. For example, for the two cases you sent, here is some device information:

2021-06-21 11:26:07.881000 {"uuid":null,"model":"Chrome","cordova":"6.0.0","platform":"browser","version":"91.0.4472.106","manufacturer":"unknown","serial":"unknown","isVirtual":false,"appVersion":"1.1.11"}

2021-06-21 11:13:38.356000: {"uuid":"88cbd09e508526ef","model":"A502DL","cordova":"9.1.0","platform":"Android","version":"8.1.0","manufacturer":"Alcatel","serial":"JBYTNZSOQWHIHMFE","isVirtual":false,"appVersion":"1.1.11"}

Sometimes, you have to guess a little but the first seems to be a Chrome Browser and the second is an Alcatel Android device. From those two instances, it looks like the person signed in on the browser after signing in on an Android device.

### Power settings from app_use_table and gps_table
We collect information about device power settings that are saved within the logging_events table *and* on each gps coordinate we collect in the gps_coordinates_coordinates table.

An event with the action "settings updated" will be saved every time one of the following fields changes. This can happen if the user opens the app a lot. These fields are encoded to save database space.

-ii: isInteractive: Is app interactive aka open or has Star is running notification active (0 = false, 1 = true)
-ipsm: isPowerSaveMode: Is device in Power Saving mode (0 = false, 1 = true)
-ic: isCharging: Is device charging (0 = false, 1 = true, -1 = not known) (Android 23 API+)
-iibo: isIgnoringBatteryOptimizations: Is app ignoring battery optimizations (0 = false, 1 = true, -1 = not known) (Android 23 API+)
-idim: isDeviceIdleMode: Is app in Device Idle Mode (0 = false, 1 = true, -1 = not known) (Android 23 API+)
-lsm: getLocationPowerSaveMode: Location Power Save Mode (-1 not known, integer, for values see documentation) (Android 28 API+)
-For more information about "idim", "ii", "ipsm", and "iibo", see https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/PowerManager
-For more information about "ic", see https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/BatteryManager#isCharging()
-For "lsm", see https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/PowerManager#getLocationPowerSaveMode()

### Location permissions information from app_use table
#### Email from Adam 2021/07/01
Statuses when saving "changing monitoring or permissions status" events.

Location Monitoring Statuses:

gps enabled: This happens when the device has Location Services globally turned on. This doesn't mean that the Star app has permission to the location data though.  
gps not enabled: This happens when the device has Location Services globally turned off.  
Location Permission Statuses:  
Can have "not granted" to "granted, coarse, fine, background"  

not granted: permission to location tracking is denied or if the person hasn't seen the permission request popup yet.  
granted: Permission to location has been granted in some way. However, locations may not be tracked if the Location Services are turned off i.e. "gps not enabled"  
coarse: Have access to low accuracy locations (within a city block)  
fine: Have access to high accuracy locations - as accurate as the gps on the device will allow  
background: Have access to location while app is not open  
From these statuses, we can guess whether the user has Location services on and if the permission has been revoked but not if they turn off the phone. Location is the only permission with this type of granularity. The permission system is not very developer friendly and we can't even tell if a user has been asked to enable a permission.

### GPS table

####  Column Names

Raw column names : what we rename it in our get_star_data() dataframe
-"id" :  "gps_id" 
-"guid" : NA
-"user_guid" : "user_guid"
-"access_token" : NA
-"latitude" : "latitude"
-"longitude" : "longitude"
-"client_database_id" : NA
-"other_data" : NA but NB- there is an other_data column joined from the access_token table which contains phone model information
-"create_date" :  "create_date"
-"delete_date"  NA
-"study_id" : "subid"
 
#### Sampling rate
2021_0219: Adjusted sampling rate for GPS to require users to move 2 meters
before a location is tracked. Location will be sampled every 2 minutes

See also Power settings from app_use_table above.

In addition to ii, ipsm, ic, iibo, idim, and lsm, the following fields are saved for each location collected:

-hacc: Horizontal accuracy in meters
-spd: Speed in meters

For more information about "hacc" and "spd", see https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Location



## CHESS Dev Notes
Collated by Adam

Last Updated: 2022-01-18
Data Collection Notes
Terminology
Open:
- Foreground: User has app open and sees it on their screen
- Background: User has opened app but it is not currently in the foreground.
 
Closed: App is not Open or has been swiped away

### Daily audio/video check-ins
Collecting media using Media Capture: https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/media-capture/
Deleting video files from Gallery database / filesystem using custom GalleryFiles plugin
Potential Issues with server space
Possible upload_status values:
status: ready|uploading|uploaded|error - local file not found
chunks_uploaded: []
final_file_write_date: <unix time>
Check-ins that haven't been completely uploaded can be found by looking for blank remote_storage_urls.

#### Process
User takes video using Star App
Star App uploads video file to CHESS server and CHESS server stores video file, location, and some other data in user_metadata database table
Save that the user completed the video checkin for the day
"upload_date" will contain the date of the recording for backwards compatibility
"remote_storage_url" will be blank until the final file is written on the server
User taken to homepage
In background (or at app start up or during app maintenance, every 5 mins): Start process for uploading video
If currently upload process is already running, stop now
Set status of uploader to "busy"
For each existing video check-in with remote_storage_url that are not blank and a null upload_status
Add "upload_status" with the following fields:
status: uploaded
chunks_uploaded: []
final_file_write_date: <upload_date>
For each video check-in with remote_storage_url that are blank and a null upload_status. 
Add "upload_status" with the following fields:
status: ready
chunks_uploaded: []
final_file_write_date
For each video check-in with remote_storage_url that are blank
Open the local_storage_uri
If local video file does not exist, go to next video checkin
Set the "upload_status" to have status = "error - local file not found"
Break file apart into 512kb chunks
Set upload_status status to "uploading"
Upload first chunk not in chunks_uploaded
On success
Add chunk number to chunks_uploaded, go back to step e
If finished uploading
Update remote_storage_url with url
Set upload_status status to "uploaded"
Set "final_file_write_date" to the date time
Set status of uploader to "ready"
Script run by Star Team reads user_metadata table to get locations of video files
Script run by Star Team downloads video files to a Star Team server for later analysis
CHESS periodically deletes old videos.

### Location Tracking
2022-01-18: The code should check for the participant's location every 90 seconds however, the participant must move 2 or more meters from their last location to record the new location. The participant also needs to have ignored battery optimization.

In order to collect location, the participant will need to have "gps enabled" monitoring status and "granted" permission status. It is possible that in certain instances, a person may temporarily disable the gps permission for the app which would show up as "not granted".

We record whenever the participant changes their app permissions for location or whether location tracking gets turned on or off. The following are statuses when saving "changing monitoring or permissions status" events to logging_events.

Location Monitoring Statuses:
Can only have "gps enabled" OR "gps not enabled"

gps enabled: This happens when the device has Location Services globally turned on. This doesn't mean that the Star app has permission to the data though.

gps not enabled: This happens when the device has Location Services globally turned off.

Location Permission Statuses:
Can have "not granted" to "granted, coarse, fine, background"

not granted: permission to location tracking is denied or hasn't been asked yet such as if the person hasn't seen the permission popup yet.

granted: Permission to location has been granted in some way. However, locations may not be tracked if the Location Services are turned off i.e. "gps not enabled"

coarse: Have access to low accuracy locations (within a city block)

fine: Have access to high accuracy locations - as accurate as the gps on the device will allow

background: Have access to location while app is not open 


### Settings and Location Other Data
We collect information about device power settings that are saved within the logging_events table and on each gps coordinate we collect in the gps_coordinates_coordinates table.

An event with the action "settings updated" will be saved every time one of the following fields changes or on each gps coordinate collected. These fields are encoded to save database space.
ii: isInteractive: Is app interactive aka open or has Star is running notification active (0 = false, 1 = true) 
ipsm: isPowerSaveMode: Is device in Power Saving mode (0 = false, 1 = true)
ic: isCharging: Is device charging (0 = false, 1 = true, -1 = not known) (Android 23 API+)
iibo: isIgnoringBatteryOptimizations: Is app ignoring battery optimizations (0 = false, 1 = true, -1 = not known) (Android 23 API+)
idim: isDeviceIdleMode: Is app in Device Idle Mode (0 = false, 1 = true, -1 = not known) (Android 23 API+)
lsm: getLocationPowerSaveMode: Location Power Save Mode (-1 not known, integer, for values see documentation) (Android 28 API+)

For more information about "idim", "ii", "ipsm", and "iibo", see https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/PowerManager
For more information about "ic", see https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/BatteryManager#isCharging()
For "lsm", see https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/PowerManager#getLocationPowerSaveMode()

In addition to ii, ipsm, ic, iibo, idim, and lsm, the following fields are saved for each location collected:
hacc: Horizontal accuracy in meters
spd: Speed in meters  
To include this information, edit get_star_data() to include "g.other_data AS accuracy_data," in the GPS SQL query.


For more information about "hacc" and "spd", see https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Location

### Log in and Log out events
There are a few ways that a user can log out or get logged out.
* Their access token expires, this happened when we first set up the site. Based on the 1009's access token, this hasn't happened.
* They fail to input their pin 10 times. According to the data, it doesn't seem like anybody has run into this issue.
* They log themselves out from the slide out menu. 1009 doesn't seem to have done this. 1006 did this on 07/29.
* They delete the app from the device. We don't get any information from the device about uninstalls but this can result in unpaired login/logout events.
* They use Star on a browser or mobile browser. We might not get any information from the browser about log outs depending on how the browser clears the cache. This could result in unpaired login/logout events.




## STAR Survey Builder: Instructions & Features

**Logging In**

1.  To access the development server, go to: <https://test.chess.wisc.edu/star>

2.  Click **"Already a participant? Tap here to login"** then use the following credentials:

    -   Email (include the space): **survey admin**

    -   Password: **uwmadison**

3.  Once you login, click on the **Site Settings** link on the homepage or in the menu (the little icon in the upper right hand corner). Then go to **Site Settings \> Surveys \> Survey Editor.**

**Important Notes**

-   If your browser refreshes **while** you are editing, you will end up on a blank page that refreshes endlessly. You will have to visit the main page, log in again, and navigate back to the survey you were editing.

-   It is recommended that you **save often** using the **"Save"** button at the bottom of the page. Unlike Qualtrics this does **NOT** save as you go.

-   In addition to saving often, it is helpful to occasionally exit the editor and re-enter. Questions may occasionally disappear and doing this often allows you to catch which questions go missing.

    -   **Note.** disappearing questions are likely caused by a guid conflict which can occur when saving happens to quickly (creates duplicate guids). These types of silent server errors can be seen as a red message in Chrome's Devtools. To open Devtools in a chrome browser hit Ctrl Shift J (on Windows) or Ctrl Option J (on Mac). This should open a sidebar with a tab called console. If a red message appears during survey editing take a screen shot of the error.

-   **Note.** that if you have multiple nodes (which is required for branching), you **must specify the destination node for all nodes** (the default is **End of Survey** so your survey will end after the first node if you don't specify this).

-   **Note.** that if you import a survey from a previous survey export, you **MUST** reassign all of the conditional displays because **ALL** of the item identifiers change when you reimport.

### Dynamic Survey Construction

-   Dynamic surveys are created with three scripts written by Susan (make_monthly_people; make_monthly_places; upload_monthly_dynamic_only). These scripts are located in the staff_scripts folder of the analysis_risk2 github repository. This script pulls surveys from STAR, inputs the right information, and publishes a survey for each person. When a participant is assigned a study_id, \<study_id\> will be used to look for the most recently published survey whose survey identifier starts with "monthly-\<study_id\>".  Surveys need to have their survey_status set to "published" with a publish_date set in unix time, seconds since the epoch.

-   The scripts that create data used in dynamic surveys are in the **"staff_scripts"** folder of the **"analysis_risk2"** GitHub repository   

### Surveys and Survey Editor Terminology

-   **"Node":** Contains a set of Pages and Questions. Similar to a Block in Qualtrics. This is the first item you must add.

-   **"Page":** Contains a set of Questions. When a user navigates through the survey, they will jump from Page to Page. You must add a Node before you can add a Page and you must add a Page before you can add a Question.

-   **"Loop & Merge Question"**: A question that lets you specify a Node to loop through for each option selected by the user.

-   **"Looping Node"**: Node being looped through from a Loop & Merge Question.

### Question Types

**Radio**

-   Select only one option

-   Answer options can have subquestions (i.e., if "Other" is selected, a textbox appears that is labeled "Please specify")

-   Most items will be radio format (including likert scale questions).

**Checkbox**

-   Select all that apply

-   Answer options can have subquestions (i.e., if "Other" is selected, a textbox appears that is labeled "Please specify")

**Loop and Merge Checkbox**

-   Things that the editor may let you do but can cause problems when taking the survey:

    -   No questions should come after a Loop & Merge question on the same page.

    -   Don't use a Loop and Merge question within a Looping Node.

    -   Questions within Looping Nodes should not jump to other nodes.

-   Recommended Best Practice for adding a Loop & Merge question as of April 2020.

    -   Create a Loop & Merge question as the last question on the last page of a Node 1

    -   Create a Loop Node 1 and add your pages/questions

    -   Create a new Node 2 after Loop Node

    -   Set both Loop Node 1 and Node 1 to go to Node 2.

-   Making replacements within content:

    -   "\${\<question identifier\>:answer}" will be replaced by the answer selected by the user from the Loop & Merge question

    -   If more than one checkbox answer is selected all questions in looping node will be displayed for answer 1, then all questions will be displayed for answer 2, etc.

    -   When using replacement questions in looping node, start any new questions (without replacement) in a new node (outside looping node). This prevents survey respondent from having to answer the question multiple times (i.e., when multiple answers are being looped into the replacement question).

-   Data will appear as:

-   Example

    -   Loop & Merge Checkbox Question (ID: foo)

        -   Content: Select all that apply

        -   Possible Answers: Foo1 (ID: foo1), Foo2 (ID: foo2), Foo3 (ID: foo3), Foo4 (ID: foo4)

        -   Answers selected by user: Foo1, Foo2, Foo3

    -   Within Looping Node

    -   Text Question (ID: bar)

        -   Content: "Tell us more about \${foo:answer}"

        -   For Foo1, content will be "Tell us more about Foo1"

        -   For Foo1, content will be "Tell us more about Foo1"

        -   For Foo1, content will be "Tell us more about Foo1"

    -   Checkbox (ID: baz)

        -   Content: "Select all that apply for \${foo:answer}

        -   Possible answers:

            -   Baz1 (ID: baz1), Baz2 (ID: baz2), Baz3 (ID: baz3)

        -   For Foo1, "Select all that apply for Foo1"

            -   User selects "Baz1"

        -   For Foo2, "Select all that apply for Foo2"

            -   User selects "Baz1, Baz3"

        -   For Foo3, "Select all that apply for Foo3"

            -   User selects nothing

-   Data will appear as

    -   Row 1

        -   question_guid: foo

        -   content: foo1, foo3

    -   Row 2

        -   question_guid: bar

        -   content: { "foo1": "Bar1", "foo2": "Bar2", "foo3": "Bar3" }

    -   Row 3

        -   question_guid: baz

        -   content: { "foo1": "baz1,", "foo2": "baz1,baz3,", "foo3": "" }

            -     NOTE: Checkbox selections always have trailing commas

**Conditionally Displayed Loop and Merge Checkbox**

-   Allows you to set conditions for displaying questions in a looping node based on answers to a Loop and Merge checkbox question

-   All of the rules and best practices from Loop and Merge Checkboxes described above apply here

-   For each question within the looping Node, set the condition for displaying question on the line that reads "Conditions for Displaying Questions (Optional)"

-   Examples can be found in Monthly Survey (monthly_final) on the STAR site

    -   demographics_change (Node 1, pg. 5, Q1)

    -   whoassist \_month_1 (Node 3, pg. 2, Q2)

**Likert Scale**

-   Likerts can be created with 2 to 15 options

-   You can include a "Not applicable" option

    -   This option can be given a custom label

-   You can specify Start and End anchor labels, but also as many intermediate anchor labels as desired.

    -   Additional Labels are spread between the start and end labels evenly.

    -   Additional Labels can be blank.

-   Response items are unreadable as Likert. Radio format preferred.

**Content**

-   Text information only

**Simple Date Picker; Multi-Date Picker; Simple Date Time Picker; Generic Date Time Picker**

-   Both multi-date and single date pickers are available, with and without time pickers

-   A check box allows you to specify if future dates should be permitted. By default they are disabled.

**Text Input**

-   Small text box

**Text Input (Only Allow Numeric Input)**

-   Numeric only text box

**Text Area**

-   Larger text area to allow multiple entry lines

**Select a US state**

-   As indicated

**Picture Options - Experimental**

-   Unknown - not used

**Upload a picture**

-   Not used

**Select Age**

-   Drop down menu of integers beginning at 1 with increment of 1.

-   Not currently used.

-   For age questions use Selectbox and define age bins.

    -   Ex. "Under 10", "10-13", "14-17", etc.

**Selectbox**

-   Drop-down menu of predefined categories.

-   Add response for each category that will be included in drop down.

    -   Ex. "Less than weekly", "1-2 times per week", "3-4 times per week", "5+ times per week"
    
### Updating STAR App Content

The app is made up of dynamic and static content, and these are updated via different processes.

**Dynamic content**

-   Dynamic content can be updated without an app update. Most dynamic content can be edited within the app by people with admin accounts (and for some features, all users). The following content is dynamic: discussion group posts, recovery resource articles, and surveys.

    -   The survey content is dynamic. You can update the surveys at any time and the changes will get downloaded to the app the next time the participant opens the app (if it is completely closed aka swiped away) or if they have had the app open for 6+ hours.

    -   Notification text is dynamic but requires a CHESS developer to update the text. 

**Static content**

-   Static content can't be updated without an app update. Static content is generally more structural components and the design of the app such as the homepage, menus, and how the app looks.

**Updating the Recovery Resources**

The survey admin account has rights to add, remove, or edit articles. In order to change the structure (e.g. changing the names of sections or adding / removing sections), STAR dev team will need to make that change and release a new version of STAR.

**Moderation of public forums**:

[See Slack post here](https://uw-arc.slack.com/archives/CKU3M2KNG/p1601925847073000?thread_ts=1601670391.057000&cid=CKU3M2KNG)

Study staff will regularly (1x a week) check the STAR discussion board to make sure that there are no posts that violate the STAR App guidelines. Posts that violate the guidelines will be removed immediately and a warning will be sent to the participant from the **"STAR Help"** live site account .   

In order to have regular engagement from users, the app needs someone in a dedicated role of maintaining activity in the public forum, who can populate it with content (youtube videos, quotations) and motivate positive content and get rid of negative posts. **We do not plan on spending time populating the message boards.**


### Rich Text Editing

-   Rich text editing is possible in the Survey Builder and in Direct Messages/Discussion Boards by using Shortcodes.

-   Link to list of available shortcodes: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/13BrsOJsDJzIJ0bnkIP_Aoj4T4liNP3rOOYg8zPfQm_U/edit>
  
## Android Accessibility Features

How accessible the study app is depends on the device, in part, and other devices that people have (e.g., braille display). (See this summary of built-in features: [https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6006564?hl=en).](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6006564?hl=en).)

| Visual Accessibility Features     | Test of STAR v.1.0.8 Accessibility Features       |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------- |
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Change Font Size | **Home menu & navigation in app**: Some items run over to 2 lines but works adequately **Daily update**: Looks fine although calendar can't actually get any bigger! **Monthly update:** Looks fine                                                          **Daily video check-in:** Looks fine                                                   |

## Obtaining Raw Data

Download the gps, sms / call, and survey data through the website by logging in as an administrator (like survey admin) then clicking on the Site Settings button from the homepage and clicking on the Data Exports button. When you click Run for each export, it will download the most current data in the database. There should already be data in each export.

 
**Create your own Test Site account:**

App site: <https://test.chess.wisc.edu/star>

Enter in Test Site ID: 4867

**ADMIN account details:**

Click **"Login"** under **"Already a participant?"** and enter

-	Email (include the space): survey admin

-	Password: uwmadison

### Automating Downloads

See git repo for the scripts used to download data for this project. This section contains general descriptions of the process.

From Adam: 

Here are some instructions for automating the data exports using HTTP requests.
>
The script you create will need to make an HTTP POST request to the following URL for the test site: <https://test.chess.wisc.edu/star/data-exports/query/run> Once we have the live site fully set up, I will send you the URL for it and you just need to switch out the URL in the script.
>
I recommend the program [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) for testing HTTP requests, particularly POST requests.
>
You will need to pass the following parameters to \<Website URL\>/data-exports/query/run
>
**token**: A user access token that is generated when a user logs in and who has access to the data exports.\
**file_type**: Type of file returned. Takes one of the following: "csv", "xlsx", "json"\
**query**: MySQL query to run on the database. Will only allow read-only queries e.g. SELECT
>
See the attached screenshot for how that would look in Postman.
>
The easiest way to get a user access token and a query to automate is to use what already exists in the Star site's data exports.
>
1.  Log into the site and navigate to the Site Settings \> Data Exports page.
>
2.  Open the browser's Developer Tools / Inspector (Opera, Chrome, Firefox, etc) or Web Inspector (Safari) by right clicking on some text and clicking Inspect or Inspect Element. Click on the Network tab. This tab records what network requests are made. Click the Run button next to the export you would like to automate.
>
3.  You should see one or two rows appear in the Network tab called "run" or "data-exports/query/run". If there are two, look for the one whose Request Method is "POST". Depending on the browser, you may need to select Persist Logs to have them appear. After you find the row, look for the Request Payload or Request to see what parameters were passed in the HTTP Request.
>
4.  Once you have the request data, copy the token, file_type, and query to your script or copy them to Postman and click "Send". You should get a 200 response status code with the data in the response body / payload. After that, you are good to go (in theory)!
>
If you encounter problems, let Adam know. Also, this involves working directly with the MySQL database without you really knowing what columns/data are available to you. If you have questions, feel free to ask and I can give you more information about the database structure.
>
Thank you,\
Adam
>
P.S. The user access token will persist until the user manually logs out. If a user simply closes the browser, they will not be logged out and the token should last forever. If you run into problems with the token expiring (i.e. a status code of 403, unauthorized), let me know.
>
P.P.S. You can use normal read only MySQL syntax in your queries such as SELECT, JOIN, UNION, GROUP BY, ORDER BY. One thing to note, for tables, you will need to wrap them in { } which is not standard MySQL syntax. We use prefixes on the tables and the curly braces sort of skirt around that issue.

### SMS/Voice
- SMS is pushed to the server immediately on opening the app and messages can be deleted by users within 30 days after which they will be 'frozen' on the server.

From Adam...

- You can use the following to filter SMS data http requests by guid and date:
- [https://test.chess.wisc.edu/star/logging/get-sms-calls-by-user?type=%25&show_deleted=false&user_guid](https://test.chess.wisc.edu/star/logging/get-sms-calls-by-user?type=%25&show_deleted=false&user_guid=)
  - For "sort_by", you can leave that blank or not even include the sort_by=. It will default to logs being listed by the send_date from most recent to least recent. You can also use the following options: "" =\> sent date desc then create date desc "create_date asc" =\> Logs from least recent to most recent create dates "create_date desc" =\> Logs from most recent to least recent create dates "sent_date asc" =\> Logs from least recent to most recent sent dates "sent_date desc" =\> Logs from most recent to least recent sent dates
[Describe final sampling rate and characterize battery usage]

### GPS 
Further updated information recorded for each location to help in debugging location tracking issues. The following fields are encoded to save database space.

-   hacc: Horizontal accuracy in meters

-   spd: Speed in meters

-   ii: Is app interactive aka open or has notification (0 = false, 1 = true)

-   ipsm: Is device in Power Saving mode (0 = false, 1 = true)

-   ic: Is device charging (0 = false, 1 = true, -1 = not known) (Android 23 API+)

-   iibo: Is app ignoring battery optimizations (0 = false, 1 = true, -1 = not known) (Android 23 API+)

-   idim: Is app in Device Idle Mode (0 = false, 1 = true, -1 = not known) (Android 23 API+)

-   lsm: Location Power Save Mode (-1 not known, integer, for values see documentation) (Android 28 API+)  (Experimental - not sure what this does yet)

-   For more information about ""hacc"" and ""spd"", see <https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Location>

-   For more information about ""idim"", ""ii"", ""ipsm"", and ""iibo"", see <https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/PowerManager>

-   For more information about ""ic"", see <https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/BatteryManager>

-   For ""lsm"", see [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/PowerManager\#getLocationPowerSaveMode()"](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/PowerManager#getLocationPowerSaveMode()%22)
### Daily Video Check ins
From Adam...
- Like the other downloads, you can make a request to a url. This will provide you with information about the video [check-ins]{.ul} collected. There is a colum called "video_checkin_remote_storage_url" which provides you with the location of the file. You will need to make a request to that URL to download the file.

- [https://test.chess.wisc.edu/star/data-exports/export/video-checkins?file_type=\<file_type](https://test.chess.wisc.edu/star/data-exports/export/video-checkins?file_type=\<file_type)

-  GET Parameters: 
- \<token\>: Must be a valid user token. This user needs to have the User Administrator permission enabled.\
 \<file_type\>: The type of file to download. Takes "json", "csv", or "xlsx". Defaults to "csv" if none is provided

For more information about making requests, see email on 8/20/20 \@ 1pm to Susan, Hannah, and John called "Automating Data Exports"

### Storing Raw Data

-   Data will be stored in aggregate and downloaded on a schedule (e.g., weekly). There will not be subject-level folders in the raw data folder.

-   Dynamic survey analyses will be done on data pulled directly from the CHESS server and not stored raw on our server.

## Key Meetings and Decisions

### 2021-02-22
**4:00pm: Susan, Dhavan, Todd, Ali met to discuss recruitment**
* We discussed the lack of response I have gotten from mailers and emails
* Todd said that he would reach out to Lynne Madden at the ATP Foundation (large OTP in New Haven, Connecticut) 
* Dhavan said he would escalate to Pete at Aurora to see if Pete can champion the study a bit more
* Dhavan and Todd recommended spotlighting the features of the STAR App in the recruitment letter/email
* Ali and Susan edited the Recruitment Letter - passed to Dhavan for final approval 
* Dhavan is going to loop in a PhD. student Lynne Cotter who has relevant experience for finding on-line recovery spaces 


### 2021-12-16
- Susan submitted the IRB update. 

### 2021-12-08

**9:00am: Gina, John, Susan, Julie, Ali met to discuss recruitment** 
* Gina mentioned that her team was also having trouble recruiting despite
using methods that had been effective previously 

* Gina, Dhavan, and
Julie all expressed support for more persistent recruitment practices
(letter, email, AND phone call) 
* Ali's work-flow for reaching out to OTPs, Day Programs, and Sober Homes will be to send an email and a letter on the same day (Monday of each week) and then to do a follow up call 4-5 business days after the letter is mailed out 
*	John will reach
out to Dave Sr to see if we could leverage his connections to SSTAR to
boost recruitment 
* Possibly reach out to Lynn Madden at Yale University?

**10:30am Dhavan, Todd, Ali met to discuss recruitment** 
* Todd noted that, to his mind, there are two groups who would want to use this technology: people in recovery who want to know how they are doing; and officials in the criminal justice system who want to keep track of defendants. The prospect of this second group might make potential participants and clinicians alike wary of getting involved 
* Todd said that RISE Iowa had success recruiting participants by partnering with Peer Recovery Coaches. He specifically mentioned Kris Kelly on his team that he will reach out to. (Ali will look more into peer recovery coaches and report back to John and Susan) 
* The Addiction Policy Forum (a nationwide nonprofit organization dedicated to eliminating addiction as a major health problem) could be a promising organization to partner with. Todd will reach out to them. 
* Todd suggested that Lynn Madden at Yale University might not be especially receptive to a study that is this technology heavy\
* Todd agreed to look over the recruitment materials with Kris Kelly, and then he will schedule a meeting with Dhavan, John, Susan, and I (possibly others?) to provide feedback and any additional recommendations

    screening surveys were not eligible. Of those, n=15 had been on MAT
    for 12-24 month, n=7 for 24-36 months

-   **Issue:** On one of the reddit posts, users started sharing their

    -   On 11/03, CHESS released V.1.2.2 onto the live website. See
        Kendra's breakdown of the changes on Slack.

    -   Starting next week this section will be replaced with a section
        on recruitment, app issues will be in the Other Issues section

**Other Update/Issues**

-   **Update:** Susan and I will be 'reactivating' risk2 admin slack
    channel were we will be having the risk2 relevant conversations we
    slack DM about so that there is a slightly more public record of the
    little day-to-day management decisions we make

-   **Issue:** On 11/04 we discovered that there had been an issue with
    the onboarding qualtrics form that was preventing the MAT Start Date
    calendar select feature from working properly but Susan fixed it

-   **Issue:** On 10/25 we discovered that 1006 and 1012 had not
    received the correct social networks survey question for their
    October monthly survey so we sent each of them the correct social
    networks survey questions and offered an additional \$10 in
    compensation

-   **Issue:** On 11/04, Hannah, Susan, and I met to discuss issues
    related to payment/reconciliation

-   **Update:** I'll be taking over the 'reaching out to potential
    recruitment sites' aspect of recruitment from Susan. The plan is to
    reach out to 2-3 independent sober homes, 2-3 subreddits, and 1-2
    larger opioid treatment providers per week, with the possibility of
    reaching out to other labs that are doing or have done studies with
    the relevant population

-   It's (tentatively) looking like call intervention last week has made
    a positive difference in 1009 and 1010's daily update compliance!
    I'll continue to monitor this.

### App Issues

and Hannah for so graciously managing them! :tada:) they will now only
be held as needed if any new issues arise

**New Issues**

**Outstanding Issues**

-   There is still an issue with navigating to high risk locations page
    of app using the push notification. This is very low priority so
    John feels comfortable leaving this issue outstanding until/unless
    Adam happens to find a non-disruptive solution

**Resolved Issues**

-   We decided that we should just turn off the compliance emails since
    we are now checking compliance daily using a script

### Other Updates/Issues

-   Update: I created a draft of an email we could send to Opioid
    Treatment Programs around the country
    <https://app.asana.com/0/337059393446106/1201245598371065/f>

-   Issue: Susan, Hannah, and I met to discuss some errors in record
    keeping and payments for the month of September that Hannah
    discovered. We came up with a few additional checks in Susan and I's
    payment process that will prevent future errors

        daily survey" so they said they were no longer interested

    strategies. I am going to monitor their daily update compliance and
    if it does not improve Susan, John and I discussed a couple of
    potential changes that we might try
-   1013: I call 1013 on 10/15 to let them know that they had hit the
    gps withdrawal criteria and if they hit any withdrawal criteria
    again they would be withdrawn from the study

    and is in the process of refilming some of them

-   Update: Susan opened back up online recruitment to subreddits and I
    am gathering information about sober homes around the country for
    her to reach out to

-   Update: Susan discovered that we can send participants a link to
    their monthly surveys via DM in the STAR app and it'll open the link
    for them in the STAR app without issue

-   Issue: We have still not heard anything from 1011 but John has
    decided to keep them on as long as they are providing GPS and to
    give the an offer to reenroll if they do reach out to us

-   1010: On 10/10, I spoke with 1010 about what factors might be
    contributing to not meeting daily update compliance requirements.
    The actionable changes we discussed included adding one more daily
    update notification later at night (i.e., 9pm), Doing more frequent
    missed daily update STAR bot messages that have the specific number
    of daily updates listed in the message (e.g., 4 missed, 6 missed, 8
    missed), "automatic" compliance bot texts before phone call
    (possibly at 6 missed daily updates?)

### App Issues

**New Issues**

-   There appears to be an issue with the video check-in uploading for
    all of our participants. We are getting 0 video_compliance for the
    current period for all participants

**Outstanding Issues**

-   Kendra has tried to QA the gps compliance emails but we still do not
    appear to be getting any

**Resolved Issues**

-   On 10/7, Susan reported to Adam that we were not able to access
    SMS/voice data. Adam notified us that CHESS had to upgrade their
    server Tuesday night and the issue appears to be resolved

### Other Updates/Issues

-   Update: I created a qualtrics form for staff to report issues while
    reviewing the daily video check-ins -
    <https://uwmadison.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_82oOWPrRL3X6eLs>

-   Update: I created a check_videos sop to delineate a schedule for RAs
    to check videos and provide a step by step to run the check_video
    script

-   Update: Susan updated the check_videos staff script so I was able to
    show abby how to complete daily video check-ins

-   Update: Susan created a "data_report_by_subid" script to do do
    deeper data reports for participants

-   Issue: On 10/04, 1010 reported that they had not received credit for
    video check-ins because they had deleted the videos from their
    camera roll before the upload was completed. I did a log entry so
    that Susan can provide credit.

-   1011: Attempted to call for a Daily Update compliance call on
    September 27th but the phone number gave me a busy tone. Continued
    to try to contact via DM, Text Message, and Email throughout the
    rest of the week.

-   1009: Called 1009 for a Daily Update compliance call on September
    27th. They sent me a screenshot of their daily task tracker that
    showed only 7 missed daily updates. Susan and I went through the
    data and discovered that there was one daily update that was showing
    up on 1009's task tracker that we had no record of. The issue was
    reported to CHESS

### App Issues

**New Issues**

-   On 9/3 1009 did not, according to the data, take a daily survey, but
    her task tracker shows that she did.

-   Two users have had days where they were able to submit multiple
    Daily Surveys per day

    -   1006 on 9/26, 9/23

    -   1012 on 9/26 (4 duplicates!). 9/17

-   1009 reported the app crashed when navigating inside the Task
    Tracker Calendar, going from September to August.

-   I discovered that if you take a daily update on airplane mode, it
    allows you to retake it multiple times.

**Outstanding Issues**

-   Adam is looking into the issues that have been reported about the
    daily updates
-   Adam has a fix planned for the pop-up notifications asking to "Allow
    STAR to delete this video" when some participants upload a daily
    video check-in. This fix will be included in the next app update.

**Resolved Issues**

-   Adam pushed v.1.1.16 to the live site on 9/28. The following issues
    are supposed to be fixed

    -   Updated how we store video check-ins in the database. This will
        make syncing data faster and more reliable. (row 257)

    -   Check-In data is now stored in the st_video_checkins table
        record_date is the same as the upload_date when using the user
        metadata All other fields are still the same

    -   Added a link to a page called Video Check-In Upload Progress to
        the Study Information page where participants can see if their
        check-ins have been uploaded. We can easily move this somewhere
        else.

    -   Reworked missing monthly survey logic. Now set to notify 1 week
        after survey window first opens and 1 day after user misses
        entire previous survey window. (row 240)

    -   Updated task reminder notifications so they come at 8am and 6pm
        if the user has not yet done them.

    -   Added gray background in progress calendar when you select a
        date.

    -   Fixed server issues with monthly update notifications where a
        participant would continue to receive notifications even if they
        completed a personalized monthly survey that was deleted.

    -   Added alert to video check-in page when not connected to the
        Internet.

### Other Issues

-   Susan and I discovered that there was a discrepancy between 1009
    task trackers and want appeared on our end. In light of this, we
    have decided to alter the Compliance Bot messaging to be more
    specific about missed task data, (ie. including dates missed) and
    also to clarify that if they think they didn't miss a task , to
    please send a calendar screenshot to help us troubleshoot.

    -   Hello,

        Our system has notified us that you have missed 2 daily updates
        in 7 days. The dates missed are:

        9/20/21

        9/23/21

        We wanted to check-in and see if everything is alright. Are you
        having any issues with the STAR app or completing the study
        tasks?

        If you think the system has made an error, please send us a
        screenshot of your task tracker calendar for these missing days.
        That will help us troubleshoot the issue and allow us to
        correctly credit you for these tasks.

**New Issues**

-   We received additional DM's from 1006 about the issues they have
    been having with the check-ins. They reported that they are still
    not receiving credit for completed video check-ins, even after
    leaving the app open for 10-15mins. They also reported that
    sometimes the STAR app switched to the Settings app, which marks the
    first time someone has been able to replicate the issue I have
    experienced on a couple of occasions. I forwarded these DM's to
    CHESS.

**Outstanding Issues**

-   Adam has continued to diagnose the video issues. He believes a
    number of these issues are related to how we store the uploaded
    video check-in in the database. As a result, Adam has proposed
    several changes that will take a few days, a new app update, and
    changes to our R scripts

**Resolved Issues**

-   Adam added back in a feature that will let people know whether or
    not they are on Wifi before doing the video check-in. We are hoping
    this will address some of the check-in issues we have received
    reports about in the last couple of weeks.

### Other Issues

-   Our doodle poll wasn't working when this person took the screening
    survey but we were able to get their contact info. I emailed on
    09/14 and they scheduled an onboarding session for 09/17. From now
    on we will do a daily check to make sure that the doodle poll is
    working as expected.

    continue but I was able to get in contact and respond to their
    concerns

-   1011 spoke with John about assisting with recruitment through their
    drug court

### Admin Procedure Updates or Decisions

-   1010 was supposed to have their one-week check-in yesterday, but did
    not answer the call and sent a text saying that they are thinking
    about discontinuing.

-   1009 technically hit the withdrawal criteria last pay period. They
    claim that they were being logged out of the app automatically.
    After I posted about it in Slack , Susan checked the data and found
    no evidence of logout activity occurring. I called them to say that
    we have decided to give her one more chance to be compliant.

### Admin Procedure Updates or Decisions

-   John had a chance to review Hannah's demo video and provide
    feedback, Hannah will create a new demo video

-   John decided that a single tutorial video should not be longer than
    10-12 mins. For our videos related to the study tasks, we could have
    the videos as follows

    -   Daily Update - Importance, window for completion, compliance and
        bonus thresholds, etc

    -   Daily Update pt2. - Walkthrough of content

    -   Video Check-In - Importance, Importance, window for completion,
        compliance and bonus thresholds, what a rose/bud/thorn are

    -   Video Check-in pt2. Actually walkthrough how to do it

    -   Monthly update - Static Content

    -   Monthly update - Dynamic content

    -   Menu - How to edit profile, change password, change data sharing
        setting

    -   Menu pt2 - Brief overview of recovery resources

    -   Guidelines

    -   Welcome and Payment video combined (?)

### Recruitment Progress

-   Last week we were notified that Mindy had found two potential
    participants and Elizabeth and I were able to onboard both
    participants without issue. It was the first time Elizabeth and I
    had officially tried out our workflow and I think it went great!

-   Today 9/3 we got an email from Mindy saying that the drug court
    judge of one of our participants said that they would be interested
    in telling defendants about the STAR study!

### App Updates

-   Adam discovered that 1006 was experiencing some lost metadata again
    with the video check-ins. He was able to rebuild the data and
    believes that the server issue has been resolved.

-   1009 also reported that in the past, the app has crashed while they
    were taking the monthly survey. Apparently anytime the app crashed,
    the app saved their place in the survey so they were able to
    complete it. Does not appear to be a critical issue but might be
    worth having Adam log into it.

-   1006 reported that the daily task tracker is not accurately
    recording their task completion. Susan and I are currently gathering
    more info. Luckily, Susan discovered that we are able to see their
    task completion accurately on the backend.

-   1006 also reported that they already took the monthly update for
    this month, but the app is requesting they take it again. Susan was
    not able to find evidence of their first attempt but we are still
    going to offer them additional compensation for retaking it

### Admin Procedure Updates or Decisions

-   We are still getting reports from our participants that there is a
    problem with the timing of daily tasks and/or the task tracker. 1006
    completed a daily update at 2:00am on Tuesday. It should have
    counted as a Monday daily update but it counted towards Tuesday.
    Susan confirmed this issue.

-   We got a direct message from 1006 saying that the app has been
    slower since the latest update. I confirmed that the app is slightly
    slower than normal.

    Wisconsin (they do not live in Wisconsin). Susan discovered that
    this was due to a coding error that should be resolved.

    you."

### Recruitment Progress

-   Hannah and John met with Aurora on to go over more details regarding

-   We mixed up the time for 1009's one-week check-in and missed it but
    they have been completing all of the study tasks so we are not too
    concerned. I followed up with an apology and one-week check-in key
    info via STAR DM and email

-   I had to notify two participants (1004 and 1005) that they should
    NOT take the monthly updates until I notify them that the surveys
    have been properly customized (even though it will become available
    on Friday, May 14th, and Monday, May 17th, respectively)

### Admin Procedure Updates or Decisions

    number of contacts that a participant can be displayed in a given
    month

-   Kendra fixed an issue with the "take survey" button on the study
    site getting cut off by removing the study phone number (since the
    phone number is in the survey)

-   I created a draft of a Study Email SOP designed to walk study staff
    through what actions to take in response to different kinds of
    emails sent to the STAR study email account
    P:/studydata/risk2/methods/sops/administration_sops/study_email_sop_2021_05_13

-   We found an issue where questions with looped responses (i.e.
    whoassist on Intake and Monthly) throw a "There are unanswered
    questions on this page" message even when all questions are
    answered. Hannah reported this issue and it should be address in
    V1.1.5. See thread for this issue here

-   We've had an issue with Participants not being able to upload video
    check-in on WIFI on the first few tries. Hannah reported this last
    week. Some participants have reported improvements with V.1.1.4 but

### Methods Decisions

-   Current launch is April 5th (no one signed up this week)

-   We decided to add more strategic bolding to the daily survey to
    encourage reading of each of the questions.

-   For Consent/Onboarding phone calls, I will initially try to do the
    call through jabber (so that the call shows up as a UW madison desk
    phone). If the call quality is bad, I will call using the study cell
    phone

-   We will text participants the link to the consent/onboarding
    qualtrics and training video qualtrics using email
    (star_psych\@wisc.edu)

### Implementation Progress

# Aurora Updates
## 2021-02-28 from Mindy 
Hi team,

2 patients were not approached, but the clinician said they will approach this week
2 patients no showed to their appointments
1 patient was ineligible due to iPhone
1 patient is interested and Elizabeth is trying to connect with them

Recruitment Updates
Craigslist is proving to be a pretty fruitful recruiting source. Susan has now posted ads in LA, Miami, San Diego, Jacksonville (FL), Philadelphia, Baltimore, NYC, Huntington (WV), Chicago, and Boston
John spoke with the Wisconsin Clinical Coordinator for Community Medical Services and their COO.
Susan ran the numbers and discovered that 40% (42) of our total enrollment has come from Ohio so we are closing off recruitment to Ohio Residents
Somehow our study got promoted on a mom's in recovery facebook group it's gotten us a couple of people!
Other Update/Issues
Update: We've altered our messaging RE:Persistent app issues - we now tell people upfront that there is a small chance the app might not work great with their phone and they'll just have to deal or discontinue
Issue: We had a second major bank issue that affected the June 15th payment. It was caused by delayed reconciliation reports. We ended up paying everyone $40 due to a 3 day delay and Susan is going to talk to our psych department contact and our bank contact to make sure reconciliations are never late again 
Issue: We are still having minor issues with the Compliance Script but it is not getting in the way of accurately tracking compliance
Issue: Now that we are advertising in craigslist, I think we should consider adding an additional question to the screening survey or consent session that could filter out people who screen eligible by lying about having OUD. If that would be to big of a protocol change, we should monitor Craigslist's recruit's intake surveys
Issue: There is a weird STAR website issue that is making it impossible to see recent direct messages from the star_bot account - Susan messaged Adam about it today
Update: Yanissa had made stellar progress on updating the R Markdown study manual and project notebook!

Recruitment Updates
I am continuing to do a deep dive into all the opioid resource centers in 5 states and sending every person I can find an email for our recruitment letter
Susan posted ad's on Craigslist in LA, Miami, and San Diego and we have already gotten a few screen eligible!
We got an email from a Wisconsin Clinical Coordinator for Community Medical Services (The provide MAT around the country) who is very interested in our study - John is meeting with the COO.
I've begun reaching out to people via linkedin
Other Update/Issues
Issue: (at least) a handful of people are still experiencing issues related to either the app crashing while trying to do a task and/or not receiving credit on the task tracker. At this point we've come to suspect it may be a phone-specific issue 
Update: I slightly changed the wording in the consent/onboarding session to emphasize the importance of the daily update and to give a disclaimer that if the app does not work well with their phone, we may have to discontinue them.
Update: Susan has been working on overhauling the compliance script

Recruitment Updates
I am continuing to do a deep dive into all the opioid resource centers in 5 states and sending every person I can find an email for our recruitment letter
Our two primary recruitment tools continue to be Reddit and word of mouth
Recruitment seems to be slowing down from Dayton and actually hopped closer to Columbus!
Other Update/Issues
Issue: We continue to get issue reports that are just a bit too frequent and a bit to similar to each other for me to not think there is a significant bug or two or three
Update: Quick Overview of New Compliance Scheme (in use as of ~May 23): Messages are sent using the STAR Study Phone
Yellow Warning - If a participant hits two consecutive periods of 4 or more missed daily updates OR if a participant misses 6 or more in a single period OR if they miss a monthly update OR if they turn Data Sharing off for 6 or more hours (though turning off data sharing has not proven to be a problem for anyone yet) Then that participant will get the Yellow Warning Message. 
"Hello - Our system has notified us that you have missed 10 daily updates since the start of your current study month (04/15/2021). As a reminder, please try not to miss more than 10 daily updates before the end of your study month (05/15/2021). I wanted to check-in and see if everything is alright. Are you having any issues with the STAR App or completing any tasks? If you think the system has made an error, please send us a screen shot of the task tracker for the missing days. This will help us troubleshoot the issue and allow us to correctly credit you for these tasks. Thank you for your participation! - Alejandra Colmenares STAR study"
Note. If it is the participants second Yellow Warning Message, "please try not to" is replaced by "You MUST not"
The third time participants meet yellow message criteria, they will likely get a red message instead (up to Susan and I's discretion)
Red Warning - aka 'Restart participation' aka Final Warning (Three consecutive periods of 4 or more missed dailys; OR missed more than 8 in single period; OR missed 2nd monthly update)
Hello (name) - I hope your first couple of months on study have been enjoyable! For the most part, your compliance so far has been great - However, you have missed more than 10 daily updates during your current study month so far (4/15-5/15). If you would like to remain a participant in the STAR Study, we can restart your participation (you won't have to do anything on your end and it wouldn't actually change anything about your participation, we would just make a note of it in our records). However - it would mean that you MUST NOT miss more than 10 daily updates during any of the remaining study months. If you do, we will have to withdrawal you from the study. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. -Alejandra Colmenares ,STAR study Research Coordinator
Non-bolded sentence is personalized to the participant
If a participant does not respond/acknowledge this message within 24 hours, I follow up with a call
I make a WOG entry whenever this message is sent marking their 'restart'
Participants will only be able to get one of these messages (barring extenuating circumstances -like participant was in the hospital or jail or something - which would be discussed with John)

I am continuing to do a deep dive into all the opioid resource centers in 5 states and sending every person I can find an email for our recruitment letter
Aurora expanded their recruitment methods/criteria and it seems to be working beautifully! We got 3 people from Aurora this week and already have another lined up for Monday (5/16)
Our two primary recruitment tools continue to be Reddit and word of mouth
Other Update/Issues
Issue: We have gotten a noticeable uptick of issue reports for the STAR app. Most of them involve the app either crashing while the participant is trying to do a task OR issues with people not receiving credit for tasks in their task tracker/calendar. Fortunately, it seems that we CAN see when people do a task even if they cant see it on their task tracker calendar and I gave instructions of how to access the web browser version of STAR for the people experiencing persistent app crashing
Update: We were able to pay the 4 participants who should have received monthly payments on 4/30. We were also able to payment all of our new participants the $20 consent payment. We have been able to pay the bulk of outstanding training/one-week payments but not all. Susan and I are tentatively optimistic that the rest of our money will be deposited on 5/16 
Update: Susan and I are working out a way to make compliance checks more sustainable as we get more participants - more details to come next week!
Update: We have had two successful debriefing sessions for our first (1006) and second (1009) participants who successfully completed the study!

 I am still in the process of trying to figure out recruiting on social media (aside from reddit) - I tried sending a few facebook messages to opioid resource org pages from my newly created facebook account but no responses yet.
I am in the process of each week, doing a deep dive into all the opioid resource centers in 5 states and sending every person I can find an email for our recruitment letter
Reddit continues to be a fruitful source of recruits but most of the people for the last couple of weeks have come through word of mouth  - particularly for group homes 
Other Update/Issues
Update: We have a system now for dealing with missing w-9's. I will reach out asking about the form one month after onboard date - if they do not respond or request a new form, at 6 weeks I will send a message saying that we will withhold monthly payments until we get it back
 Update/ possible Issue: We have gotten a LOT of people in group/sober homes and (i would guess) lapses are less likely among that group because (i would guess) they get drug tested regularly
Issue: 4 participants were not able to get paid on 4/30 because our Focus Blue account ran out of money. Susan has been in close contact with the new reconciliation person and USA bank to resolve the issue
Update: We are letting participants know that payment dates that fall on the weekend will be paid the next business day - this will help with payment day concerns/questions that I always get day of
Issue: We have had a lot of issues running compliance due to CHESS issues with Data storage. John and Susan met with CHESS on 5/2 to discuss the issues. Susan was able to get the code back up and running though!
We have an new RA (Yay Yanissa!) joining the lab full time for the summer (June 15th)

 Since early March/ late February we have been getting a steady stream of screeners (about 10-15 a week). Much of this has been through reddit and  participants recommending the study to people that they know (I take care to mention that we will be actively recruiting for the next several years). There is also evidence that the emails I have been sending out has yielded participants. The stream of participants has slowed a bit as of 04/01 - so this week (04/04) I will refocus my efforts on new recruitment streams - especially on social media
Other Update/Issues
Issue: On 03/22 - we discovered that 1039 had their card overwritten by 1040 due to a qualtrics error - Susan was able to resolve the issue and we sent 1039 a replacement card
Issue: On 03/15 - 3 participants got left off of the file funds upload. Susan was able to fix the script and I was able to manually pay those participants
Update: Susan and I discovered that my usbank account can easily transfer funds FROM a participants account back to our account
Issue: We have made 3 failed attempts to get 1031 their payment card (all were returned to us as undeliverable). They put their address as the clinic they attend. We added a warning about using non-residential addresses as their mailing address. 1031 will get us a private address sometime this week (04/04) or next week.
Update:Our participants have started using the discussion board! We have three posts so far - with about 4-5 participants making posts or comments. I am monitoring to make sure that they do not break the app guidelines but and not yet seeding topics.
Issue: We discovered that we are missing W-9 forms from 4 participants who have been on study for longer than a month. I sent out replacement w-9's to those 4 participants. Only one participant (1017) did not respond to my message asking them to verify their address for the w-9 form.
Issue: We have not received many competitive applications for our new position. 
@Susan Schneck
 would it be possible to open the post up to people who are going to be graduating this year? I feel like that would open up the talent pool by a lot!

 On 03/10 - Dhavan sent in his edits to the recruitment letter. The new recruitment letter is in the recruitment folder on the p drive
 We still have not had any eligible/interested people from the MAT clinic that Aurora is partnering with.
I am making emails my primary recruitment tool for the moment
Most of the screenings we have gotten over the past couple of week have been through word of mouth.
Other Update/Issues
Issue: on 03/04 Doodle had a massive outage and Susan created a very handy scheduling qualtrics survey to help in the interim. Doodle is back up (for) now.
Issue: On 2/28, the us bank prepaid admin site was not AGAIN allowing me to batch uploads, so I paid all of the relevant participants using Funds Transfer
Issue: We discovered that a second participant (1027) has long periods of missing GPS despite not turning off any permission  
Issue: Susan discovered more data collection issues. Susan will be meeting with Adam to discuss data collect and data storage
Update: In the proj-risk2-admin channel, Susan and I decided each participant will have their own thread so it is easier to keep track of
Update: The IRB approved the change where we're not saying that they are "signing" the consent form when participants enter their name into the consent qualtrics

 On 02/22 - Susan and I met with Dhavan and Todd. They gave great tips for the recruitment letter (just waiting on Dhavan for a final pass). Todd will reach out to Lynn Madden (President of ATP Foundation - an OTP ) and Dhavan will reach out to Aurora
 We still have not had any eligible/interested people from the MAT clinic that Aurora is partnering with
I tried posting to Craigslist in a way that would make it free but the posts were all removed.
My facebook account is allowing me to send messages to facebook pages, so I will start doing those this upcoming week (Once I get the letter back from Dhavan)	
I will also start reaching out to all Recovery Cafes around the country
We now appear to be getting a semi-steady stream of screen eligible people (3 sessions week of 14th, 3 sessions week of 21st, 4 sessions scheduled for this upcoming week). Mostly though people who are on study already and clinicians at centers that I sent flyers
Other Update/Issues
Update: on 2/15 Susan created a NEW screening survey Qualtrics and retired the old one. 
Issue: On 2/15, the us bank prepaid admin site was not allowing me to batch uploads, so I paid all of the relevant participants using Funds Transfer
Issue: I discovered that most (22 out of 26) of the screen eligible people we got in that rush of screening surveys had google voice numbers and were using VPNs 
Update: Susan added Hannah's payment video to the Training Qualtrics
Issue: On 02/23, Susan discovered that we had not gotten SMS or Voice, for anyone since 02/21. Susan was able to resolve the issue
Update: The IRB approved the change where we're not saying that they are "signing" the consent form when participants enter their name into the consent qualtrics

Hi team,

 

Slow week this week. We were hoping for a bunch of warm handoffs in IL, but there were no eligible patients on Wed, and Thursday the only potentially eligible patient was screened out due to iPhone. Here is the weekly summary:

 

1 patient was not approached
1 patient did not show
1 patient was not interested due to privacy concerns
1 patient was not eligible because is going back to jail soon, so no phone
1 patient was not eligible due to iPhone
 

-Mindy

## 2022-02-11 from Mindy 
Hi team, here is our week:

 

3 patients not approached by clinician
1 patient wanted to think about it (a very polite, Wisconsin way of saying no)
1 enrolled
4 were ineligible due to iphone
1 is being approached this afternoon by the clinician if they show
 

-Mindy

Email From Mindy:
Hi team,


We are very much looking forward to launching warm research handoffs with you tomorrow! As discussed during our intro meetings last week, the proposed process will be:

 

We will email you all and Dr. Rusnak-Bubash with the list of potentially eligible patients early in the morning.
Dr. Rusnak-Bubash (or anyone else on the team) may approach the patient with the proposed script.
If the patient is interested in learning more about the study right now, the last person in the MAT clinic to see the patient for the day will send Elizabeth Wanninger a Teams message indicating the person is eligible (no PHI!) and provide a clinic phone number for Elizabeth to call. Or you can tell Elizabeth you are sending her an email with PHI and she'll watch for it.
Elizabeth will immediately call whatever number you provide and handle the patient from there.
The patient may or may not enroll in the study. If not enrolling, the phone call will likely last 5 minutes. If enrolling, the call will likely last around 30 min.
If a patient is not eligible or not interested, please let us know so we can make sure we do not approach them again.
 

Feel free to contact me or Elizabeth with any questions at any time. We're both available by Teams or by cell:

 

Mindy Waite: 608.206.3947

Elizabeth Wanninger: 414-454-9395

## 2022-1-28 from Mindy

Email From Mindy:
Hi UW team,

 

I spoke with the new IL clinic we had recently onboarded in for the STAR study. They are a MAT-focused clinic funded through a large grant that's just starting now. They currently only have patients on Wednesday mornings between 9-12 (sometimes up through 1pm) and only have around 4-5 patients per day, with a 50% no show rate. The grant will allow them to significantly expand, and they plan to have patients 6 days per week starting in June. They have a full support staff of clinicians, including therapists, prescribers, nurses, and peer support specialists.

 

All this is to say, on the two days we've looked at them for STAR patients, they have been a rich source of patients and highly responsive to approaching patients, and we think they're a really promising source moving forward.

 

I chatted with their clinic manager today to lay out the issue we're having with the cold handoffs, and she suggested that we use warm handoffs instead, which she is willing to have her staff support. What this means is that, on the Wednesday mornings when we know potentially eligible patients are coming in, we will need both Elizabeth and Ali to be at the ready for a warm handoff. Elizabeth and I were sort of picturing the peer support specialist telling the patient about the study to gather interest and then saying, *Hey, while you're here, let's A) get you set up with the study if eligible or B) connect with the study team to set up an enrollment time.*  Then they can text Elizabeth who will call the patient's cell phone right then and also bring on Ali if the patient is enrolled.

 

I realize asking two people to have their schedule relatively blocked over 3 hours is not wildly efficient, but Elizabeth and Ali could be working on non-time-sensitive tasks in the meantime, and I think it will significantly increase our enrollment rate compared to the low success rate of cold handoffs, which will be worth it. At a very minimum, I think we should test this strategy.

 

Thoughts on this? Cc'ing my two one-ups just for visibility.

3 not approached by clinician
1 requested the PDF to think about it
2 not eligible due to iphone
1 not eligible due to flip phone
1 not cognitively eligible per MD

Hi team,

 

Here are our STAR updates from the last two weeks. A little slow, so I'm looking forward to your IRB updates. Also, just FYI that the Illinois MAT site is going to increase from .5 days every 2 weeks to 6 days per week in February of 2022, so that should help with enrollment coupled with the updated eligibility criteria.

 

2 participants enrolled (although one was not actually eligible because they did not have an Android, even though they confirmed during screening that they did)
1 person was interested but then never responded to further outreach attempts
1 was indicated not eligible by their clinician (although no reason was given)
6 participants were not approached by their clinicians to our knowledge
1 no showed

Hi team,

 

I'm back from vacation last week and just catching up. Here are our results from last week (plus Monday):

 

2 patients were ineligible due to iPhone
1 patient was not interested in learning more
1 patient was not approached by clinicians
1 patient was interested in the study but then had privacy concerns about the study because they use their phone for *confidential work matters*

Hi team,

 

I'm late on the weekly update. Last week, we had 9 potentially eligible subjects:

6 were not approached (all 6 under 2 providers who lost staff and were overwhelmed last week)
1 was not eligible due to iphone
1 was not eligible because he is too acute and not consistently taking his MAT
1 was eligible and interested but is unsure whether the commitment is too much and still thinking (I'm sure Elizabeth communicated this very interesting and honest hesitation)

she left a VM for one (the other does not have VM set up); she will
follow up with them each once more by calling

An MD was asked to approach 3 today; no response yet from the MD

Apologies on the delay in update. Slow week due to Elizabeth being
gone R/F and this Monday. Nevertheless, we were able to identify
several eligible people:
>
1 patient enrolled
>
2 no-showed to their appointments
>
3 were not approached by the clinician
>
2 indicated interest, and Elizabeth will follow up with them tomorrow

Hi team, It's been a slow week in terms of responses from providers.
We emailed providers about 6 patients, and I don't think any patients
were approached (although one is scheduled for today, so we'll watch
that). We have learned, however, that these providers prefer messaging
from within our EHR and often don't check our email, so we are going
to change our strategy. Further, Elizabeth is starting to go into our
psych hospital daily for enrolling patients into the contingency
management study, which will allow her to provide verbal reminders to
clinicians before outpatients arrive for visits. As a result, we are
expecting our hit rate of patients actually being approached to
increase significantly after this week. -Mindy
