# Measures {#sec-measures}

## Continuous Collection

Continuously while participants are on study, personal sensing measures
in A-CHESS will capture information related to moment-to-moment changes
in risk, including data from phone calls, text messages, GPS location
services, and people's use of the mHealth app features. Phone call, text
message, and GPS information will be enhanced with contextual
information about frequent social contacts and frequently visited
places.

 

## Daily Update

Each day that participants are on study, they will complete a short
survey that includes items related to daily changes in risk: the drugs
people have used in the past 24 hours; whether people took their daily
MAT medication; and, thinking of the past 24 hours, how well they slept,
their mood, their pain, urges to use, risky situations, pleasant
situations, motivation to avoid using opioids, and confidence in
remaining abstinent.

-   See `P:\\StudyData/risk2/methods/measures`

 

## Daily Video Check-In (NO LONGER ACTIVE AS OF FEB 2023)

Each day participants will record a short video check-in using their
front-facing phone camera that shows their facial expressions and
captures their voice as they reflect on how they are doing that day. We
will create predictive features from these videos using natural language
processing and other techniques (e.g., to characterize affective cues in
people's vocal tone and facial expression).


**Check Videos SOP**

Check Video SOP (the purpose of this SOP is to describe how to review
daily video check-ins)

Schedule for Checking Video Check-Ins - One business day before a
participants scheduled one-week check-in... o On the weekday before a
participants one-week check-in, study staff should check all the videos
that the participant submitted that week o Study staff should make a
note if the participant... -- Does not include their face in the camera
-- Is not facing or looking at the camera -- Is not in a well-lit room
-- Is difficult to hear (either not speaking loudly enough or is
recording in a noisy space) -- Does not specify whether they will be
sharing a rose, a bud, or a thorn -- Does not explain what the rose,
bud, or thorn is -- Does not explain why they chose the rose, bud, or
thorn -- Says that they are having an issue with the app • Note. We
explicitly tell participants that the video check-ins are NOT a way to
communicate with staff so this is pretty unlikely - A couple of times a
week (depends in large part on how many participants we have on study) o
Study staff will have a rotating list of subids that should have a
sample of their past month of videos reviewed o Each participant on
study will have their videos review at least once a month

Open the R Script - Navigate to your local github repository for
analysis_risk2 - Open the RISK2 R project o In R studio, open the
staff_scripts folder o In staff_scripts, open the check_videos.Rmd
script Step 1: Set up and Step 2: Download videos - "site" should be set
to "live" - "the_subid" o Study staff will have to check each subid
individually o Set "the_subid" equal to the subid you are trying to
review - "period" o Set to "week_one" if completing a pre-one week
check-in review o Set to "past_month_sampled" if doing a regular
review - Run step 1 - Run step 2 Step 3: Play videos - Run step 3 - Use
the risk2_video_checkin_checklist Qualtrics to note any issues -

## Monthly Update

The monthly update that participants complete will differ slightly some
months.

***Static risk***

At the beginning of the study, participants will complete a survey that
includes measures of the following characteristics related to static
risk: demographics; lifetime substance use history (items adapted from
the World Health Organization Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance
Involvement Screening Test, Version 3); opioid treatment history; opioid
use disorder DSM-V diagnostic criteria for the year prior to starting
MAT; distress tolerance (items selected from the Distress Tolerance
Scale); pain catastrophizing (items adapted from the Pain
Catastrophizing Scale and Pain Catastrophizing Scale for Children);
personality traits relevant to psychopathology (Personality Interview
for DSM-IV Brief Form); adverse childhood experiences (items selected
from the Adverse Childhood Experiences Questionnaire); and trauma
experience.

 

***Dynamic risk***

Each month that participants are on study, they will complete a survey
that includes the following measures related to monthly changes in risk:
life circumstances (e.g., employment status, living situation); social
connectedness (adapted from the MOS Social Support Survey); romantic
relationship quality (items selected from the Relationship Assessment
Scale); psychiatric symptoms (items selected from the BASIS-32); pain
and anticipated pain treatment (items adapted from the Wisconsin Brief
Pain Questionnaire and the Pain, Enjoyment, General Activity Scale);
stress (items selected from the Perceived Stress Scale); quality of life
(items adapted from the World Health Organization Quality of Life
Assessment); substance use (adapted from the World Health Organization
Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test, Version 3);
opioid use; opioid recovery satisfaction and motivation; other recovery
goals; questions about treatment use, adherence, and perceived efficacy
including questions about MAT, self-help meetings, counseling,
psychiatric medication, and detox or other inpatient residential
treatment.

From the second month forward, the monthly update will include questions
about social contacts and visited locations (see below for more
information).


**Dynamic risk - Social contacts**

To contextualize social contacts data (phone call and text/SMS message
logs), participants will complete a short self-report survey about
contacts that are identified as potentially meaningful to the person
based on the duration and frequency of voice calls and text messages.
This survey will ask people about the relationship type and closeness,
the valence of typical interactions, and the extent to which
interactions support or undermine their recovery.

**Dynamic risk -- Visited Locations**

To contextualize visited locations data (GPS location), participants
will complete a short self-report survey about the places they
frequently visit (i.e., more than twice a month). This survey will ask
people about the type of place, what they typically do there, the
valence of spending time there, and the extent to which spending time
there supports or undermines their recovery. When available, public
information (e.g., via OpenStreetMap) about locations will also be used
to contextualize GPS data. This contextual information (i.e., public
data and the data the participant provides) will be used to create
predictive features (e.g., changes in routine movement patterns, length
of time spent at a specific place or place type) from the GPS location
data.

 

**Burden**

In the third month and the last month, participants will be asked
questions about burden. Specifically, we will collect self-reported
ratings on how much participants dislike a personal sensing signal and
any positive or negative comments participants have about the signals.
For the daily update, daily video check-in, and monthly updates,
participants will also provide ratings on how much the signal interfered
with their daily activities.

In the final month, the monthly update will only contain questions about
burden and social contacts and visited locations.

See `P:\\StudyData/risk2/methods/measures`

### Timing of the monthly update

From the CHESS team:

-   The logic treats the intake survey, personalized monthly survey, and
    monthly survey all as "monthly" surveys so if a person completes the
    intake survey during the window, they have to wait until the next
    window take the regular or personalized monthly survey.

 

-   Then the following logic applies for deciding which survey to take
    is:

1.  If they haven't taken the intake survey, take the intake survey now.
2.   If they completed the intake survey and they have a personalized
    monthly survey to take, take the personalized monthly survey now.
3.  If they completed the intake survey and they do NOT have a
    personalized monthly survey to take, take a regular monthly survey.

 

### Social contacts

Criteria for identifying a phone number as a frequent contact:

-   A number not identified as spam AND

-   At least one phone call (outgoing or incoming) more than 2 minutes
    long on two different days in a month OR

-   A phone call (outgoing or incoming) of 15 minutes or more OR

-   A one-on-one (not group) exchange of text messages (at least two
    outgoing texts and two incoming texts) during the month

 

### Visited locations

Criteria for identifying a visited location: GPS observation with a next
time of  \> 3 minutes or GPS observations within 60 meters of a GPS
observation with a next time of \> 3 minutes

If people report that they do not recognize a location or were just
passing by, we will ask them about it if it reappears on a future
survey, but only one time (i.e., people will only need to report that
they don't recognize a location or they were passing by twice

### Intake Survey (Content)

**Global Instructions**

This is the first monthly update. It consists of different surveys that ask about aspects of your life and your recovery including your age, income, household, history of opioid and other drug use, drug treatment services, life events, and emotions. This first monthly update is longer than other monthly updates because it asks questions about your background.

Completing this survey will take about 30 minutes and you will receive a $10 payment for completing it.

Please read through all questions carefully and answer them honestly. All of your responses will be kept completely private.

  < page break >

The term **â€œopioidâ€** in these surveys refers to prescription opioids (like Oxycontin or Vicodin), synthetic opioids (fentanyl), and heroin. Below is a list of commonly used terms for these substances:

**Oxycodone** (Oxycontin, Percocet, oxy, percs, O.C., rims, tires, greenies)

**Hydrocodone** (Vicodin, Lortab, Norco, vike, bananas, fluff, hydros)

**Morphine** (Kadian, Duramorph, MS Contin, miss Emma, monkey, white stuff, M)

**Codeine** (lean, captain Cody, little C, schoolboy)

**Buprenorphine** (Suboxone, Subutex, buse, sobos, strips, oranges)

**Hydromorphone** (Dilaudid, Exalgo, smack, dillies, footballs, juice)

**Methadone** (Methadose, Dolophine, tootsie roll, red rock, mud, dolls)

**Oxymorphone** (Opana, biscuits, mrs. O, O bomb, octagon)

**Tramadol** (Ultram, chill pills, trammies, ultras)

**Fentanyl** (Sublimaze, Actiq, apache, goodfella, TNT)

**Heroin** (black tar, black pearl, black, china white, dope, white lady, smack, snow, speedball)

< page break >

When we ask about your use of opioids or other drugs, we often use the term **â€œnon-medical reasonsâ€** When you see this term, please think about your use of drugs to feel intoxicated or high. This includes taking more of a drug than you were prescribed, taking it more frequently than prescribed, or using a drug for reasons other than it was prescribed for.
