#### No-Show Consent Onboarding (Google Voice)

Hello!  

This is {YOUR NAME} from the UW-Madison STAR Study. We had an onboarding call scheduled for this time, and I was unfortunately unable to reach you. I will be free for the next 30 minutes if you are able to call back. If you are still interested in participating but need to reschedule, you can reschedule up to 3 times using this link:

As a reminder, the session will take 20-30 min and you receive a $20 payment for successfully completing the session. Thank you for your time and I hope you have a great rest of your day!
