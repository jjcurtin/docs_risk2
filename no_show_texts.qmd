# No-Show Texts {#sec-no-show-messages}


<center>(This SOP has scripts for various texts to send to participants if they miss a session. Staff should first reach out to see if the participant is able to take the call, and then follow-up to reschedule as needed. If able, staff should wait 15-30 minutes to allow the participant to show up.)</center>

#### No-Show One-Week Check-In (Google Voice Text)

Hello!  
This is {YOUR NAME} with the STAR Study Team. I just tried to call for your one-week check in but was not able to reach you. Is now still a good time? The call should take about 5-10 minutes, and you will receive $10 for its completion. 
If this time no longer works for you, please let me know your availability over the next couple of days and I can easily get you rescheduled.
Thank you!
{YOUR NAME},  
STAR Study Team

Hello!  

This is {YOUR NAME} with the UW-Madison STAR Study. I just tried to call for your scheduled consent and onboarding session, but I'm afraid I was unable to reach you. Is now still a good time? The call should take about 30 minutes, and you will receive $20 if you choose to participate.
Thank you,
{YOUR NAME},
